<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>PREPARATIONS FOR SCHOOL.</h3>
</div>

<p>Bitumen was what its name suggested.
There was soft coal and smoke everywhere.
Each day the clothes on the line were flecked
with black. The buildings had the dull,
dingy look which soot alone can give. The
houses sagged on either side of narrow, unpaved
streets, where during a rainy period
ducks clattered about with their broods, and
a few portly pigs led their shoats for a mud
bath.</p>
<p>During a summer shower barefooted urchins
waded knee-deep in the gutters, their
trousers rolled to their thighs. Irish-Americans
shot mud balls at black-eyed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
Italians; Polanders and Slavs together
tried the depths of the same puddles; while
the little boys of the Russian Fatherland
played in a group by themselves at one end
of the square.</p>
<p>The houses were not so much homes as
places of shelter. Walls painted red were
the popular fancy. Although there was
room enough, gardens were unknown, while
blooming plants were rare enough to cause
comment. Each dooryard had its heap of
empty cans and pile of ashes. Ill-kempt
women stood idly about the doorways, or sat
upon unscrubbed steps with dirty babies in
their arms.</p>
<p>Bitumen was not a place of poverty.
There was plenty of work for the men, and
good wages if they chose to earn them.
They lacked nothing to eat or wear.
Money, so long as it lasted, was spent with
a prodigal hand. The Company store kept
nothing too good for their palates. Expensive
fruits and early vegetables were in
demand. The cheap finery bought for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
young folk lasted but a few weeks, and was
tossed aside by the next &#8220;pay day.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was one saloon in the place. It did
a thriving business in spite of some unseen
influence working against it. Its proprietor
was one Dennis O&#8217;Day, who held the politics
of the little town in his palm. He was
a little brighter, a little keener and much
more unscrupulous than the other men of
the place, but he felt at times the force of
some one greater than himself, and it was
always directed against his business. He
perceived it when he received orders that,
in fulfillment of the law, he must remove
the blinds before his windows, and keep his
place open to the public view. He felt it
again when he received a legal notice about
free lunches, closing hours, and selling to
minors. Never once had he stepped beyond
the most rigid observance of the law but he
was called to account for it. He knew some
keen eye was upon him and some one ready
to fight him and his business at every turn.</p>
<p>The great blow came when the Club House
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
was established. An empty store-room had
been fitted up with chairs and tables and a
supply of books and magazines. Here the
boys had the liberty of coming to smoke and
talk together while Joe Ratowsky served
coffee and sandwiches cheaper than O&#8217;Day
could sell beer.</p>
<p>It was not Ratowsky&#8217;s doings. There
was some one else behind the scenes who
provided the brains and money to keep the
business moving. Dennis O&#8217;Day meant to
find out who that person was and square accounts
with him. But for three years he
had been no nearer the truth than now. To
learn anything from Ratowsky was impossible,
for the man had a tied tongue when he
chose.</p>
<p>In the midst of all the dirt and squalor
there was one touch of dainty hominess and
comfort. This was found near Mountain
Glen, where the superintendent of the mines
lived. The house was an unpretentious
wooden building with great porches and big,
airy rooms, but the windows shone in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
sunlight, the curtains were white as snow,
and the worn floors of the porches were
always scrubbed.</p>
<p>In front and at the sides of the house was
a lawn mowed until it looked like a stretch
of moss. Masses of scarlet sage and cannas
grew near the house, while at the rear a
white-washed fence gleamed white.</p>
<p>The superintendency of the Bitumen
mines was not the most desirable position,
cutting off, as it did, the man and his family
from all congenial companionship. The
salary attached was fairly good, quite sufficient
to provide a comfortable, if not luxurious,
living. The present incumbent had
begun his profession with other ambitions
than living in a little mining town.</p>
<p>Twenty years before, Mr. Hobart, then
newly married, had every prospect of becoming
prominent in his profession. He
had new theories on mining and mine-explosives.
He had brought to perfection a
substance to destroy the explosive gas which
collects in unused chambers of mines.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>Just at the time when the mining interests
were about to make use of his discovery, his
health failed from too close application.
He was threatened with consumption,
brought about by inhaling poisonous gases.
He was ordered from the laboratory into the
mountains. The Kettle Creek Mining Company
offered him a position at Bitumen,
one of the highest soft coal regions in the
world. The air was bracing and suited to
his physical condition. Confident that a
few months would find him restored to
health, he accepted. But with each attempted
return to lower altitudes the enemy
came back, and months passed into years,
until he came to look upon Bitumen as the
scene for his life work.</p>
<p>Here his only child, Elizabeth, was born.
Here she grew into girlhood, knowing no
companionship except that of her parents
and Miss Hale, a woman past middle age,
who, in her youth, had travelled abroad and
had spent the greater part of her time in
the study of languages and music. She had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
come to Bitumen with her father for the
same reason that had brought Mr. Hobart.</p>
<p>She had a quaint old place just at the
edge of town. Here, during the warm
weather, she cultivated flowers and vegetables.
In her home were unique collections
of botanical and geological specimens, books,
and music. She found recreation in painting
both in oils and water colors, and in
plaster-casting.</p>
<p>She paid little attention to dress. Most
frequently she might be seen in a gown ten
years behind the fashions, driving a dashing
span of horses along the rough mountain
roads in search of some member of the mission
school in which she was interested.
Most of the miners were Catholics, but here
and there among them she found members
of her own church and sought to bring and
keep them together. Her appearance might
cause a stranger to smile, but when once he
heard her cultivated voice, and caught the
varying expression of her face, he forgot all
else.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>Miss Hale taught Elizabeth French and
music. Few days in recent years had been
too cold or stormy to keep her from driving
down the rough road to the Hobart home
for the sake of the lessons.</p>
<p>The other branches of his daughter&#8217;s education,
Mr. Hobart took under his own
charge. He taught her mathematics as conscientiously
as though he expected her to
enter his own profession.</p>
<p>This line of work had not been a burden
to her. She had her father&#8217;s aptitude for
study, and took up an original problem in
geometry as most girls take up their fancy
work.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had no girl friends at Bitumen.
Her father was the only really young person
she knew, for although in years he was
not young, yet in the joy he took in living,
he was still a boy. He had the buoyancy
of youth and the ability of manhood. No
laugh came clearer or more often than his.
No one could be dull in his presence.</p>
<p>His daughter took part in his pleasures.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
She was interested in his work; even his
business affairs were not unknown to her.
There was one subject, however, with which
she was not acquainted. Many times while
she was at her books, her parents with Miss
Hale were deep in a discussion, which ceased
when she joined them.</p>
<p>She had finished her second reading of
Cicero, and reviewed all the originals in
solid geometry. Her summer suspension of
study was about to begin. She was conscious
that something of importance to herself
was brewing in which she took no part.
Miss Hale had made unusual visits and had
been closeted with her parents for hours.
One day Elizabeth sat studying in an upper
room, and from her window she saw Miss
Hale drive away. At the same instant her
father called, &#8220;Elizabeth, Elizabeth!&#8221;</p>
<p>She ran down-stairs. Her father and
mother stood at the foot looking pleased.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know she will be glad,&#8221; her mother
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course she will,&#8221; replied her father.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>She paused on the stairway in wonder.
She was very good to look at as she stood so.
Her soft hair was drawn loosely back from
her face, and hung in a long, fair plait down
her back. She was not beautiful, only
wholesome looking, with a clear, healthy
color, and large, honest eyes. Her dress
was a simple, inexpensive shirtwaist suit,
but every article about her was in order.
There was no sagging of belts, or loose
hooks.</p>
<p>Her father held out a book as she came
toward them. He was brimming over with
joy at the prospect of her delight.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a catalog of Exeter Hall, Elizabeth.
That is the school Miss Hale attended.
I&#8217;ve looked over dozens of catalogs
and this pleases your mother and me
best. We want you to go in the fall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; was all she said then, but it was
expressive enough to satisfy her parents.
She had read stories of schoolgirl life
which seemed more like fairy stories than
experiences of real girls.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Look it all over, Elizabeth. The course
of study is mapped out. We think the
classical course suited to you. Your mother
and I are going to drive down to the mines.
Study the catalog while we are gone and be
ready to tell us what you think of it when
we come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>She needed no second bidding to do this.
By the close of the afternoon, she had read
and re-read the prospectus. She became so
excited she could scarcely sit still. There
was one matter which did not fully satisfy
her. She had advanced beyond the course
at Exeter in some branches and smiled as
she read the amount of work laid out in
botany for the Middle Class. She had far
exceeded that, for she had found and mounted
every specimen of plant and flower that
grew for miles around Bitumen.</p>
<p>The cost of a year&#8217;s schooling was a surprise.
Her father and Miss Hale could
teach her everything that the course at Exeter
included. It seemed foolish to spend so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
much money when all could be learned at
home.</p>
<p>That evening Miss Hale drove over to see
how Elizabeth was pleased with the prospect
of going away to school. The matter was
discussed from all points of view. Then
Elizabeth expressed the thought which had
come to her while studying the catalog:</p>
<p>&#8220;But I have had more work than the
Freshman and Middle Classes require. It
would not take me long to complete the work
for the Senior year. I want to go,&mdash;I think
I have always wanted to go to school, but
it seems such a waste of money. You can
teach me more, I can really learn as much
at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her father laughed, &#8220;Impossible! The
girls at Exeter will teach you more in one
term than I can in a year. I do not expect
you to be a Senior. I shall be more than
satisfied with your entering as a &#8216;Middler.&#8217;
You&#8217;ll need plenty of time for extras.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Extras? What extras must I take?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chafing-dish cooking and fudge making,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
replied Miss Hale, promptly. &#8220;It
will take a full term for you to find your
place among young people, and learn all they
will teach you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they will know no more than I do,&#8221;
said Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not so much; but what they
know will bear no relation to what they
teach you. I&#8217;m willing to promise that you
will learn more from your roommate than
you do from any instructor there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth glanced from one to the other.
She failed to understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will have no more lessons after to-morrow,&#8221;
said Mrs. Hobart. &#8220;Elizabeth
and I will begin putting her clothes in order.
There will be a great deal to do, for
she will need so much more at school than
she does at home. We do not wish to
hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only eight weeks yet,&#8221; said Elizabeth,
&#8220;I wish I was going next week.&#8221;</p>
<p>The day following the work on the outfit
for school began. &#8220;Plain and simple,&#8221; her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
mother declared it should be. But Elizabeth
fairly held her breath as she viewed
the beautiful articles laid out to be made.</p>
<p>&#8220;This pale blue organdie will do for receptions
and any public entertainments you
have,&#8221; her mother explained. &#8220;Every girl
at school needs some kind of a simple evening
dress. You&#8217;ll need a cloth suit for
church and shopping. Then, of course, the
school dresses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every morning Elizabeth on her way
down-stairs to breakfast slipped into the
sewing room to view the new dresses. She
had never so much as thought, not to say expected,
to own a rain coat and bath robe,
and a soft eider-down sacque. But there
they lay before her. Their existence could
not be questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think the other girls at Exeter
will have so much?&#8221; she asked of Miss Hale.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to look as though I was trying
to out-dress anyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you find they have less than you, keep
some of your good things in your trunk.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
You do not need to wear them all,&#8221; was Miss
Hale&#8217;s advice. &#8220;No doubt they are fixing
themselves up, too,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had never thought of the matter
before. Now the mere thinking about it
seemed to bring her into relation and sympathy
with those hundreds of unknown girls
who were, like her, counting each penny in
order to spend it to the best advantage, all
the while looking forward to the first of
September.</p>
<p>It came at last. The big trunk was
brought down from the attic. The new
dresses were folded and packed. The books
which she might need at Exeter were put
into a box. The trunk was locked and carried
into the lower hall, waiting for the drayman
to call for it early the following morning.</p>
<p>At this juncture going away from home
changed color. It was no longer something
to look forward to with pleasure, but something
to dread. Elizabeth was not the only
one who felt the coming separation. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
noticed through a film of tears that the best
linen and china were used, and that her
favorite dishes had been prepared for the
last home supper.</p>
<p>Despite their feelings, each made an effort
to be cheerful. Mr. Hobart told incidents
of his own school-days, and rallied
Elizabeth on being homesick before she had
started.</p>
<p>Afterward, they sat together on the porch.
The father and mother talked but Elizabeth
sat silent. She was thinking that the next
evening would find her far away and among
strangers. She dreaded meeting girls who
had been reared with others of their age,
and who had been in school before, feeling
that she would appear very awkward and
dull until she learned the ways of school.
She half wished that her father would tell
her she need not go. She came closer and
seating herself on the step below him, rested
her head on his knee. &#8220;Father, I do not
wish to go to Exeter. May I stay home
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
with you and mother? Be a good daddy
and say &#8216;yes.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be good and say &#8216;no.&#8217; Our little
girl must go away to-morrow. I can&#8217;t tell
you how lonely we shall be, but we have had
you so long that we were almost forgetting
that you had a life of your own. We must
not be selfish, so we send you off, bag and
baggage.&#8221; Her mother added: &#8220;Unless
she oversleeps, which I am sure she will unless
she goes to bed right away. It is later
than I supposed. Come, Elizabeth.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she spoke, Joe Ratowsky came across
the lawn. In the moonlight, he looked like
a great tawny giant. He spoke in English:
&#8220;Mr. Hobart, that beeznez is no good. He
no stay to-morrow. To-day homes he goes
quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is his home? Doesn&#8217;t he live
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dennis O&#8217;Day, b&#8217;gosh, niver. So many
as one children he have. Milton, he live.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t he bring his family here?
I didn&#8217;t know the man was married.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Umh&mdash;yes, b&#8217;gosh. His girl tall like
your girl. He no bring her. He proud like
the tivil. Never he tell his girl what he do
here&mdash;no, b&#8217;gosh, he don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, come in and I will talk the matter
over. We can&#8217;t do much else than wait.&#8221;
Then turning to his daughter, &#8220;Good-night,
Elizabeth, I must talk to Joe now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth ascended the stair. Joe&#8217;s visit
had taken her mind from her going away.
She wondered what the Pole could have in
common with her father. Joe was not even
a miner.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>THE JOURNEY.</h3>
</div>

<p>Only accommodation trains ran between
Bitumen and Exeter. Elizabeth found
herself in a motley crowd of passengers.
To her right sat a shabbily dressed mother
with a sick baby in her arms; back of her
was a plain little woman of middle age
dressed in a gingham suit and rough straw
hat; while before her sat two young women,
perhaps a year or two older than herself.
They talked loudly enough to attract the attention
of those about them. Elizabeth
learned that the larger was named Landis,
and her companion &#8220;Min.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were handsomely though showily
dressed. Min seemed to be less self-assertive
than her companion. Landis evidently
had confidence enough for two. She frequently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
turned to look around, gazing into
the faces of her fellow passengers with a
self-assurance that in one of her age
amounted almost to boldness.</p>
<p>She had been careful to arrange her
jacket that its handsome buckle and silk lining
were in evidence. She was a girl of
large physique, with broad shoulders, which
she carried rigidly. This, with the haughty
pose of her head, attracted attention to her
even in a crowd.</p>
<p>Her companion was as tall, but more slender.
It was evident that she looked up to
Landis and depended upon her in every
emergency. A reader of human nature
could have seen at a glance that she was the
weaker.</p>
<p>From their conversation, it appeared they
knew all places and people of importance
along the route. As the train stopped at
Westport, Landis viewed the town with critical
eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tacky little hole, isn&#8217;t it? I should simply
die if I were compelled to live here.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You would never stand it. You&#8217;d run
away, Landis, or do something desperate.
Isn&#8217;t this where the Gleasons live?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It used to be. But they live at Gleasonton
now. They have a perfectly elegant
place there. Of course, it is just their summer
home. I&#8217;d like to take you down there
sometime. I feel like taking the liberty for
they are such old friends. They are in
Washington during the winter. He&#8217;s
United States Senator, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever been there to visit them,
Landis?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How could I, Min? I&#8217;ll have to leave
all such times until I&#8217;ve finished school and
have come out. I don&#8217;t doubt that Mrs.
Gleason will ask me there for my first season.
She&#8217;s not a society woman. She
hasn&#8217;t much ability that way, and has sense
enough to know it; so she goes in for charity,
and temperance work, and all that.&#8221;</p>
<p>A suppressed exclamation from the seat
behind her caused Elizabeth to look around.
She was just in time to see the plainly-dressed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
woman suppress a laugh. As Elizabeth
glanced at her, she was pretending absorption
in a magazine, but her lips were yet
twitching with amusement.</p>
<p>The baby across the aisle began a low,
fretful cry. The mother soothed it as best
she could, holding it in her arms, patting it
on the back, and trying all manner of devices
to keep it quiet. A little boy several
years old was on the seat beside her, and
the instant the baby began to fret, he set up
a distinct and independent howl of his own.</p>
<p>Landis made no attempt to conceal her
discomfort.</p>
<p>&#8220;How annoying!&#8221; she exclaimed in tones
that could be heard half the length of the
car. &#8220;Anything but a crying baby! Why
don&#8217;t women with babies stay at home? It
wouldn&#8217;t matter so much if there was a decent
train on this road, but one can&#8217;t get a
Pullman for love or money. If there is
anything I despise, it&#8217;s traveling with a
mixed set. You never know whom you are
getting next to.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>Her companion agreed, offering her subtle
flattery in sympathizing that one of her
station should be compelled to mingle with
such people.</p>
<p>Again Elizabeth, in her hurried glance,
caught a twinkle of amusement in the eyes
of the woman back of her. Elizabeth could
form no opinion about the girls in the seat
ahead. She had no precedent to guide her.
All she knew was learned from her parents
and Miss Hale.</p>
<p>The train had been advancing at a steady
if not rapid rate. They had descended the
mountain, and were moving close to its base
through a country barren of vegetation and
population. There came a sudden jolt,&mdash;then
a creaking sound as the train gradually
slowed and then stopped.</p>
<p>The passengers looked from the window.
No station or village was in sight. There
was a moment of uneasiness. A few men
got up and went to see what the trouble was.
An half-hour passed. The restlessness expressed
itself in words. Some complained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
loudly; some grumbled, others walked up
and down the aisle, every few moments looking
at their watches, while their faces grew
more expressive of displeasure and annoyance.</p>
<p>The baby across the way fretted. The little
boy cried aloud. The tired mother worried
over them until she herself was almost
sobbing.</p>
<p>The half-hour lengthened into an hour.
Then a trainman entered the car with the
unpleasant news that they would be delayed
yet longer. The air-brake had failed them,
and they must wait until the wreck-train
came down from Westport with another car,
so it might be an hour before they would be
able to proceed.</p>
<p>The girls, Landis and Min, left their
places to walk up and down the aisle. Landis
looked infinitely bored. She turned to
her companion with deprecatory remarks
about second-class traveling, where one
could not have either a lunch or dinner.</p>
<p>The dinner hour had passed. Some of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
the travellers who had a day&#8217;s journey before
them had fortified themselves against
hunger with a lunch.</p>
<p>The baby continued crying. The older
child clamored loudly for something to eat.
Elizabeth crossed the aisle.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look tired,&#8221; she said to the mother.
&#8220;Will you trust your baby with me?&#8221; She
held out her arms, but the child clung closer
to its mother while its fretful cry grew
louder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I can persuade her to come,&#8221;
said Elizabeth, going to her lunch box and
returning with an orange. The bright color
attracted the child at once. Elizabeth took
her in her arms and began walking up and
down. The other passengers, absorbed in
their lunches or growling at their own discomfort,
paid little attention to her.</p>
<p>The little boy continued his pleadings for
something to eat. The mother endeavored
to call his attention to other matters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you nothing for him?&#8221; asked
Elizabeth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>The woman&#8217;s face flushed at the question.
She was a subdued, worn-out little soul
whose experience with the world had made
her feel that every one was but awaiting an
excuse to find fault with her. Her manner
as she replied was more apologetic than explanatory.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I hain&#8217;t. I counted on being home
before noon. My man has a job in the
brickyard at Italee, and we&#8217;d been there now
if the train hadn&#8217;t stopped. I was up to
Leidy a-buryin&#8217; my mother,&#8221; she added, as
though she expected that Elizabeth might
blame her for being on the train at all.</p>
<p>Landis and Min had gone back to their
seats. Hearing this bit of conversation,
Landis turned her head to look at Elizabeth
and her friend. Judging from her expression,
she had no sympathy with a girl like
Elizabeth who could hob-nob on a train with
a common-looking person like this woman.</p>
<p>Landis turned back to her companion,
who had opened a small leather lunch-case
and was spreading out napkins on the seat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
before her. The napkins were of heavy
linen with drawnwork borders. The drinking-cup
was silver. The lunch was in harmony
with its service. There were quantities
of dainty sandwiches, olives and pickles,
fruits, the choicest bits of roast chicken,
slices of meat-loaf, and several varieties of
cake and confections. The sight of it was
quite enough to make one&#8217;s mouth water.</p>
<p>The lady back of them had also opened
her lunch. She, too, had heard the conversation
between Elizabeth and the woman
with the babies. Arising with her lunch in
her hand, and a traveling cape over her arm,
she came over to where Elizabeth stood with
the baby.</p>
<p>&#8220;The trainmen tell me we shall have an
hour to wait,&#8221; she said, addressing them.
&#8220;I see a pretty little bit of grass out here,
not far from the car. There is shade, too.
Don&#8217;t you think it would be pleasant to sit
out there and eat our lunch together? It
would be rest from the close car.&#8221;</p>
<p>Undoubtedly she was one whose suggestions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
were followed, as she expected them
to be now. Before she had ceased speaking
she had the boy in her arms, and was on the
way to the door. The mother and Elizabeth
with the baby followed.</p>
<p>A narrow green bank lay between the railroad
and the creek. A large forest oak
stood there, making the one bit of shade
within sight. The woman, with the boy in
her arms, hurried to this. Spreading out
her traveling cape, she put him down upon
it, and immediately taking a sandwich from
her lunch, placed it in his hands. His cries
ceased. He fell to munching the sandwich,
at intervals giving expression to his enjoyment.</p>
<p>Elizabeth trudged after with the baby.
She had never carried such a burden before,
and was surprised to find how heavy the
frail little child was. It was all she could
do to keep it from slipping from her arms,
or jumping out over them. The uncertainty
of what its next move would be caused her
to clutch it so tightly that her muscles and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
nerves were at a tension, and she was glad
to put it down on the cape also. The
mother, with her eyes open wide at this unexpected
goodness of strangers, was close at
her heels.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s her sleeping time,&#8221; she explained.
&#8220;That&#8217;s what makes her fret so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will she eat a piece of orange?&#8221; asked
Elizabeth, preparing to remove the rind.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know but what she will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth held it out. The baby knew
whether she would or not. Instantly her
fingers closed about it, and carried it to her
mouth. It was only a few moments until
the eyes closed and the child was fast asleep
with the bit of orange tight in her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your husband works at Italee?&#8221; asked
the woman of the child&#8217;s mother, as she was
arranging her lunch for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m, he works in the brickyard there.
We hain&#8217;t been there long. I was just up
home buryin&#8217; my mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your husband&#8217;s name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Koons&mdash;Sam Koons. He&#8217;s a molder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
They pay pretty well there. That&#8217;s why we
moved. He used to work up at Keating;
but it seemed like we&#8217;d do better down
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no brickyard at Keating?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; but there&#8217;s mines. Sam, he&#8217;s a
miner, but he&#8217;s takin&#8217; up the brick trade.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I see. I do not wonder that you
were glad to leave Keating. It surely is a
rough place. I have never known a town so
reeking with liquor. There&#8217;s every inducement
there for a man&#8217;s going wrong, and
none for his going right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m,&#8221; said Mrs. Koons. Her deprecatory,
worried expression showed that she
appreciated the disadvantages of the place.
&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve always told Sam,&#8221; she
continued in her apologetic, meek voice.
&#8220;When a man&#8217;s trying to do his best and
keep sober, there&#8217;s them what would come
right in his house and ask him to drink. A
man may be meanin&#8217; well, and tryin&#8217; to do
what&#8217;s right, but when the drink&#8217;s in his
blood, and there&#8217;s them what&#8217;s coaxin&#8217; him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
to it, it hain&#8217;t much wonder that he gives up.
Sam, he&#8217;s one of the biggest-hearted men,
and a good miner, but he&#8217;s no man for standin&#8217;
his ground. He&#8217;s easy-like to lead.
We heard there wasn&#8217;t no drinkin&#8217; places
about Italee&mdash;they wasn&#8217;t allowed&mdash;so we
come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I&#8217;ve heard that Mr. Gleason tried
to keep the place free from drink.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m, but folks down there say that the
Senator don&#8217;t have much to do about that.
It&#8217;s his wife that does all the bothering.
She&#8217;s the one that tends to that. Her bein&#8217;
a woman and trustin&#8217;-like, mebbe, is what
makes it easy to deceive her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, they do deceive her, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m. There hain&#8217;t no drinkin&#8217; places
open public-like. A stranger couldn&#8217;t go in
there and buy a glass of anything; but them
what&#8217;s known can get pretty much what they
want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone keeps a speak-easy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m. Big Bill Kyler gets it every
week, and the men get what they want.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Bill Kyler&mdash;um-m,&#8221; said the lady.
&#8220;And where does he get it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dennis O&#8217;Day, the man what owns the
brewery and the wholesale house, sells to
him. Big Bill drives down in the afternoon
and comes home after dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Each Saturday, you say?&#8221; asked the
woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the conversation, Elizabeth had
also been emptying her lunch-box. She listened
eagerly to the conversation between
her companions. This Dennis O&#8217;Day was
the man who was doing all in his power to
demoralize Bitumen. She was interested
because she knew of him, and moreover, by
the feeling that these questions were asked
from more than passing curiosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;This O&#8217;Day is about at the end of his
string,&#8221; continued the lady. &#8220;There are too
many people watching him, eager to find
him overstepping the letter of the law. I
can promise you, Mrs. Koons, that he or his
friend, Bill Kyler, will not be long at either
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
Gleasonton or Italee. But come, let us dispose
of the lunch while the babies are taking
care of themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had arranged the repast as daintily
as her surroundings would permit. Several
discarded railroad ties served as a table.
Over these, she had spread napkins. Together
the three sat at the improvised table
until not a scrap of lunch remained.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know how hungry I was,&#8221; said
Mrs. Koons. &#8220;We have to drive five miles
to the station and that gets us up pretty
early. An&#8217; by the time I got the children
up and dressed and got dressed myself, I
hadn&#8217;t no time to eat much. I was just settin&#8217;
down when pap drove round and told
me I should hurry up or we&#8217;d miss the train,
and I couldn&#8217;t miss it, for Sam was expectin&#8217;
me to-day. He&#8217;s been gettin&#8217; his
own meals and he wanted me back home; so
I didn&#8217;t scarcely finish my coffee. I was expectin&#8217;
that I&#8217;d be home in time for dinner,
and I would if the train hadn&#8217;t been late.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t get to Italee to-night, then,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
said her benefactress. &#8220;There&#8217;s only one
train a day from Gleasonton to Italee and it
has gone by this time. They don&#8217;t wait on
the accommodation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t I? Isn&#8217;t there?&#8221; Mrs. Koons&#8217;
countenance fell. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve got to get
there! There hain&#8217;t no one I know in Gleasonton.
If it wasn&#8217;t for carrying the children,
I&#8217;d walk. It hain&#8217;t more than five
miles, and mebbe I&#8217;d meet someone going
up. The trucks come down pretty often.
I&#8217;ve got to get there even if I have to walk.&#8221;
Back of her years of repression, her native
independence showed. She had set out to
reach Italee, and she meant to. Difficulties
like a walk of five miles with two children
in her arms might hamper but not deter
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not worry about that. I get off at
Gleasonton, and I&#8217;ll get someone to drive
you over. The roads are fine now and it
will not take long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m. Oh, thank you! It will be kind
of you, I&#8217;m sure, for walkin&#8217; with two babies
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
in your arms ain&#8217;t very pleasant. Do
you live in Gleasonton, ma&#8217;am?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not living there now. All summer
I have been out on the Creighton farm beyond
Keating.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hain&#8217;t it lonely out there? I&#8217;ve driv
by. It&#8217;s fixed up grand with big porches,
and swings, and loads of flowers and all that,
but there hain&#8217;t a house for miles about.
I&#8217;d think you&#8217;d find it lonely?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all. I take my children along,
and I&#8217;m too busy while I&#8217;m there to be
lonely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re a married woman then, and
have a family of your own. I was a-thinkin&#8217;
just that thing when you picked up little
Alec here. You had a knack with him that
don&#8217;t come to a woman unless she&#8217;s used to
handling young ones. How many children
have you? They&#8217;re pretty well grown, I
suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Elizabeth caught the merry twinkle
of amusement in the woman&#8217;s eyes.
&#8220;Really, you may think it strange,&#8221; she replied,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
&#8220;when I declare that I really am not
certain how many I have. There are so
many that, at times, I almost forget their
names. None of them are grown up; for
when they are, I lose them. They go off
into the world&mdash;some do well and some do
not. One or two remember me; but the others
forget that such a person as I ever
lived.&#8221; It was not in a complaining tone
she spoke, rather in a spirit of light-hearted
raillery.</p>
<p>Elizabeth smiled. She understood the
speaker, but Mrs. Koons did not. Elizabeth
had been accustomed to hear Miss Hale
speak thus of her mission boys and girls.
Miss Hale looked upon them as a little family
of which she was the head.</p>
<p>Mrs. Koons was amazed. She had heard,
in a misty way, of a woman who had so
many children she did not know what to do,
but she had never heard of one who had so
many that she did not know how many. Yet
she supposed that such a thing might be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
true, and accepted the statement in good
faith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pap was tellin&#8217; me when I was home
that Senator Gleason had bought the farm,
and it was him that fixed it up so grand.
Pap says they&#8217;ve only Jersey cows on the
place,&mdash;no common stock&mdash;and chickens that
they raise for layin&#8217;, and some for hatchin&#8217;,
and some that&#8217;s for eatin&#8217;. But the Senator
don&#8217;t never stay up there much. He
farms just for fun. But he must work
pretty hard to get any fun out of it. I was
raised on a farm and stayed there till I was
married, and I never saw no fun anywhere
about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the laugh and again the merry
twinkle came to her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just the way we&#8217;re used to. If you
had never been on a farm, perhaps you&#8217;d
think it lots of fun to stay on one for awhile.
I&#8217;m sure I thoroughly enjoy every minute
I spend on the Creighton farm. The days
are far too short for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But perhaps you don&#8217;t have no work to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
do. Gettin&#8217; up early is what makes it
hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I get up at daybreak, and I am busy
every moment. I wash and dress and feed
a dozen children. I have no moment to myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly Mrs. Koons seemed to understand.
&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad,&#8221; she said sympathetically.
&#8220;Life&#8217;s pretty hard for a woman
when she&#8217;s a family and has to look out for
herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they had finished their lunch, and
began gathering and folding the napkins,
Elizabeth observed something which had escaped
Mrs. Koons&#8217; notice. The left hand of
their unknown companion bore a heavy gold
band, undoubtedly a wedding-ring, guarded
by a diamond noticeable for its size and brilliance.
Her hands, too, were worthy of notice.
They were white and soft, showing
both good care and skilled manicuring.
They were not the hands of one accustomed
to manual labor.</p>
<p>As Elizabeth assisted her in clearing away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
the remains of the lunch, the conversation
was directed toward herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;You got on the train at Bitumen,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;I took particular notice of you, for
there one expects to see only foreigners
board the car.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth smiled. She knew how few
were the times when an American-born
woman or girl ever was seen near the station.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are mostly foreigners there,&#8221; she
replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you find it dull?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never have so far. But then I never
have known any life but that at Bitumen.
This is my first trip away from home.&#8221;
Her companion looked at her keenly. &#8220;Expectant
schoolgirl&#8221; was written from the
top of Elizabeth&#8217;s fair hair to the soles of
her shoes. Her linen traveling dress was
conspicuously new, as were her gloves and
shoes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are going to school, then?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; to Exeter Hall.&#8221; Elizabeth wondered
in her own mind how she knew.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll like it there. That is, unless you
are the exception among girls. I was a student
there over thirty years ago. I liked it,
I&#8217;m sure. And every girl student I&#8217;ve ever
met, and I meet them by the score, has no
voice except to sing its praises.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know many of the students there
now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I met most of those who were there last
year. Some I knew quite well. Of course,
the Senior class will not return, and there
will be many new students. Those I hope to
meet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never had any girl companions,&#8221;
said Elizabeth. &#8220;I expect to like all the
girls.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the smile. She shook her head decidedly
in negation at Elizabeth&#8217;s remark.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; you will not like them all,&#8221; she replied.
&#8220;Exeter Hall is like a little world.
We have some fine girls there, but we have,
too, some that are petty and selfish. Exeter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
Hall has sent forth some of the noblest
women I have ever known, and it has also
sent forth some that simply cumber the
earth with their presence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would think they&#8217;d be able to keep that
last class out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it could be done. But the Hall
is for the girls&mdash;not the girls for the Hall.
Some flighty, irresponsible girls, under the
influence of the school, develop into strong
characters, and leave there to do good work.
But there are always a few who fritter their
time, and leave the same as they enter. But
even these must be given the opportunity
for development, if they are capable of it.
You know that is true even in public
schools.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know nothing about it,&#8221; was the reply.
&#8220;I never went to school a day in my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How then, child, do you expect to enter
Exeter? The requirements are considerable,
and the examinations rigid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been admitted. Miss Hale and my
father taught me. Miss Hale said I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
ready for the Middle Class, and they admitted
me on her statement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And well they might. They would take
Julia Hale&#8217;s word for anything. Who that
knew her wouldn&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know her, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a student at Exeter. That means
I know Julia Hale by report, at least. But
I was more fortunate than the most of girls.
I really met her and knew her well. Your
father helped Miss Hale prepare you for
school? Who is your father? I do not
know your name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hobart! My father is superintendent
of the mines at Bitumen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of him, but I have never met
him. He&#8217;s doing good work there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;He hopes by
Christmas to have every chamber supported
by new props, and an exhaust engine which
will pump out the gas and make explosions
impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was not thinking of the mines when I
said he did good work,&#8221; said her companion,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
and after a pause, &#8220;I think it is time
we were getting into our car. I would not
like the train to pull out without us. Look
at the babies! Both asleep. Perhaps I
can move them without wakening them.&#8221;
But already Elizabeth had taken up the
baby in her arms and was at the step of the
car. As she waited for a trainman to help
her on, she caught bits of the conversation
between two men who stood on the rear platform
of the smoker. They had been discussing
the &#8220;coal-fields&#8221;, and were looking
up at the mountain which they had just descended.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s plenty there to supply the country
for the next ten years. I wasn&#8217;t thinking
of the supply when I spoke, but of the
possibility of not being able to get it out.
You remember how the hard-coal region
was tied up for eight months or more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s little danger here. The miners
are satisfied&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;satisfied until an agitator comes
their way. If I was the Kettle Creek Mining
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
Company, I&#8217;d keep that man out of my
community. He&#8217;s bound to stir up bad
blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;s left the mining business. He&#8217;ll
not trouble himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not unless he sees more money in it.
Matters have not been going his way lately.
Someone has been dogging his steps, and his
business is falling off. You know there&#8217;s
really little money in that business if a man
keeps within the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I pity that man Hobart if your
friend begins his work. Hobart&#8217;s a fine fellow,
but is not accustomed to deal with men
in the underbrush.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hobart will take care of himself. He&#8217;s
had his eye on&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>At this moment the porter came to her assistance
and Elizabeth heard no more. She
wondered at their talk, but she was not uneasy.
She had unbounded faith in her
father, and felt that he would be able to protect
and take care of himself under all circumstances.
Entering the car, she deposited
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
her sleeping burden on the seat. The
others followed with the boy and the wraps.</p>
<p>Landis and Min had finished their lunch.
There were several sandwiches, a chicken
breast, half a bottle of olives, and cake untouched.
This Landis gathered together in
a heap in her napkin. She arose and leaned
toward the window. As she did so, the lady
with whom Elizabeth had been talking
touched her on the arm. But it was too
late. The contents of the napkin had at
that moment gone out the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg pardon,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I was about
to ask you not to throw that good lunch
away. There&#8217;s a woman, a foreigner, with
her children in the rear of the coach, who
has had nothing to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know that it is my place to provide
it for her,&#8221; cried Landis, with a
haughty toss of her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry that you see the matter in
that light,&#8221; was the rejoinder. &#8220;There are
so many little mouths to be fed that I dislike
to see good food wasted. Extravagance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
can be so extreme as to become a sin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know that it is anyone&#8217;s affair
what I do with my lunch,&#8221; was the response.</p>
<p>The woman smiled, not at all affronted
by the lack of courtesy shown her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I make many things my affairs,&#8221; she
said sweetly. &#8220;I think it my duty when I
see a girl as young as you doing what is not
right to remind her, in a spirit of love and
tenderness, of her error. I am sorry if my
suggestion can not be received in the spirit
in which it was given.&#8221; Then she went
back to her place.</p>
<p>From the conversation of the two girls,
Elizabeth caught such expressions as &#8220;that
class of people,&#8221; &#8220;counting each penny,&#8221;
&#8220;bound down by poverty,&#8221; and similar
phrases.</p>
<p>The train had started on its way. A
half-mile passed before it again slowed up.
&#8220;This is Gleasonton,&#8221; said the lady, arising
and coming to Mrs. Koons to assist her with
the children. With a farewell nod and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
smile to Elizabeth, they quitted the car.
From the window she saw them try to make
their way through the crowd of loafers
which had gathered about the platform.
Suddenly a young colored boy in snuff-colored
suit and high hat appeared. He immediately
took charge of the children, and
with them in his arms pushed his way to
where a carriage stood at the curb, the
women following close at his heels.</p>
<p>As the train pulled out, Elizabeth saw
them bowling down the country road in a
wide-open barouche, with coachman and
footman in livery.</p>
<p>It was not long until the trainman called
&#8220;Exeter!&#8221; Elizabeth gathered up her
wraps and magazines. She knew that she
might expect a carriage from the Hall at the
station to meet the students.</p>
<p>Landis and Min had also gathered together
their belongings. As the train drew
into the station, they were first on the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Jimmy Jordan!&#8221; they cried together,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
as a young colored boy with an expansive
grin came up to take their luggage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmy, how&#8217;s the Hall?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmy responded with a grin just a little
more expansive than the previous one.</p>
<p>Elizabeth stood close at their side. &#8220;Are
you from Exeter Hall?&#8221; she asked the boy.
Having received an answer which she supposed
an affirmative, she handed him her
checks and the baggage which she carried in
her arms. The girls whom the boy had addressed
as Miss Kean and Miss Stoner led
the way. Elizabeth followed at their heels,
and in a few moments the three were being
driven rapidly to Exeter Hall.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>THE DINNER EPISODE.</h3>
</div>

<p>A drive of several miles through a beautiful
country brought them to their destination.
Elizabeth was surprised, for neither
her father nor mother had prepared her for
the beauty of the place; a long stretch of
campus, with great forest trees, beyond
which were the tennis-courts and athletic
fields; then the Hall itself. The original
building was a large wooden mansion with
wide porches and spacious rooms with low
ceilings. But for years this had served as
a home for the president of Exeter, the
school itself having been removed to the
newer buildings of gray stone.</p>
<p>The carriage passed through shaded
drives which led to the front entrance.
Arm in arm, groups of girls in white gowns
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
were moving about or sat in little groups beneath
the trees.</p>
<p>During the drive Elizabeth&#8217;s companions
had chattered continuously. Elizabeth had
paid little attention to them. Her eyes
were on the new country about her.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be nearly dinner-time,&#8221; exclaimed
Landis, as the carriage turned in at
the entrance to the campus. &#8220;The girls are
all out. I hope we&#8217;ll be in time to go down
with them. But we&#8217;ll have to go in and do
the &#8216;polite&#8217; with Miss Morgan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nora O&#8217;Day is back,&#8221; exclaimed Miss
Kean. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that she out there on the
campus with Mary Wilson?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be. Mary Wilson and she were
never friends.&#8221; As she spoke, Landis
leaned eagerly from the window to get a
view of the campus. &#8220;It can&#8217;t be Miss
O&#8217;Day,&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;She and Mary are
not the same style at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Miss O&#8217;Day&#8217;s swell looking.
Don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She has plenty of money and knows how
to dress,&#8221; was the rejoinder.</p>
<p>They had reached the entrance door.
Jimmy Jordan, who appeared to be general
utility boy, dismounted to open the door for
them. Then he led the way into the great
hall and on to the office, throwing open the
doors before him with energetic officiousness,
giving one the impression that he was
the most important personage at Exeter
Hall.</p>
<p>On entering the office, a woman advanced
to shake hands with Miss Stoner and Miss
Kean. With a few words of greeting, she
dismissed them each with a bunch of jangling
keys, and the information that they
were to occupy the same rooms as the previous
year. Then she turned to Elizabeth.
&#8220;This is Miss Hobart?&#8221; she said, shaking
her hand cordially, and drawing her forward
to a chair. &#8220;Your father wrote me
that you would arrive to-day. Jordan,&#8221;
to the boy who stood grinning at her side,
&#8220;Miss Wilson is somewhere on the campus.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
Ask her to step to the office, please. Miss
Wilson will be your roommate. She will
take charge of you. If you will excuse me,
I&#8217;ll return to work which claims me.&#8221; She
turned to her desk and was soon absorbed
in correspondence.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was thus given an opportunity
to study her. She was a tall woman, so tall
and slender that these qualities first impressed
those who saw her. Yet later, when
one stood beside her, you discovered to your
surprise that she was merely the average
woman in height. It had been her carriage,
her manner of holding her head, which gave
the impression of unusual height. One
might have thought her critical and stern
had it not been that the expression of her
eyes, which were gray and unusually large,
was gentle and shy. Her well-shaped head
was crowned with coils of brown hair
touched with gray drawn loosely back from
a broad, low forehead. She was a woman
who could not pass unobserved in a crowd,
yet she was not beautiful. It was that her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
presence was felt, rather than she herself
observed. She had said little to the new
student; yet the direct effect of her presence
caused Elizabeth to be glad she had come to
Exeter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, here is Miss Wilson!&#8221; Dr. Morgan
arose. &#8220;Miss Wilson, Miss Hobart will be
your roommate. I shall put her in your
care.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl extended her hand. She was not
nearly so tall as Elizabeth. Her yellow
hair without ribbon or comb hung about her
ears. She shook her head and flung back
her locks like a spirited young horse tossing
its mane. Her eyes were brown and dancing
and her face was brimming over with
fun. Her voice was high pitched and so
cheery that her hearers were compelled to
believe that she was at that minute having
the best time of her life.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been expecting you,&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;I was hoping you would come to-day so
that we could get to housekeeping to-morrow,
for lessons begin the next day.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>She led the way into the hall. Here she
stopped to clap her hands in order to call
Jimmy&#8217;s attention. &#8220;Here, Jimmy, take
this lady&#8217;s checks and bring her trunks up
to No. 10. If they are there before we get
back from dinner, Jimmy, there&#8217;ll be a piece
of cake for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmy grinned and rolled his eyes, then
swung himself down the hall in search of
the baggage.</p>
<p>Miss Wilson never ceased her chatter as
they entered the side hallway and mounted
the stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The students must not use the main
stairway, except during commencement
week, under penalty of death,&#8221; she explained.
&#8220;That&#8217;s reserved for the Fac and
other Lord-Highs. Here&#8217;s our room&mdash;quite
close to the stairway. A nuisance, you&#8217;ll
find it. Every girl on her way up or down
will drop in to see us. It won&#8217;t be because
we&#8217;re popular, but one can&#8217;t help wanting
to rest after climbing stairs, and our chairs
are particularly easy.&#8221; Her voice, as she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
talked, had a ring of laughter in it which
made Elizabeth feel, for the moment, that
having your friends love you for your chairs
alone was the greatest fun in the world.</p>
<p>She led the way into their apartment.
There was a big sitting-room with wide windows
overlooking the campus; an open grate
with log and gas fixtures, ready for the
cooler days of autumn, filled the space between
the two windows. From this room a
door led to a bedroom devoid of all furnishing
except the simple essentials of a
sleeping-place.</p>
<p>Miss Wilson drew forward a chair. &#8220;Sit
here a moment to rest. Let me put your
wraps away. I&#8217;ll make a guest of you to-day.
It isn&#8217;t long until dinner-time. We
are expected to change our dresses. But
Miss Morgan will excuse you to-day as you
have just arrived. I think you will like the
girls here.&#8221;</p>
<p>She chatted on while Elizabeth rested and
prepared for dinner. She looked with admiration
upon Elizabeth&#8217;s linen frock and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
long braid of smooth hair. &#8220;I like the way
you braid your mane,&#8221; she laughed, giving
a toss of her own. &#8220;It&#8217;s the style of hair
I&#8217;ve always coveted. A siege of fever a
year ago is responsible for my new crop,
short and curly. I look forward to the time
when I, too, can appear with dignity and a
coil of hair about my head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think you could be dignified
then?&#8221; asked Elizabeth shyly. She was
standing in the middle of the bedroom with
towel in hand. At her words Miss Wilson
tossed her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you will prove like the other
girls here. They can not be brought to realize
how much such trifles have to do with
one&#8217;s manner. Short curls bobbing over
one&#8217;s shoulders and dignity can never go together.
But let me put my hair up high
and get on a trained skirt and you will see
what you will see. People are bound to live
up to their clothes. That is why, on general
principles, I disapprove of bathing and gym
suits. They give the wearer such a sense of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
freedom.&#8221; She laughed again. Elizabeth
knew not whether she were serious or joking.
She was so effervescing with good
humor that her companion had no opportunity
for a moment&#8217;s dullness or homesickness.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the ten-minute bell,&#8221; she exclaimed,
as they returned to the study.
&#8220;That is our last warning, and gives no one
an excuse to be late. You will find Exeter
rigid in many ways, Miss Hobart. Miss
Morgan is what I call a crank on development
of character. She keeps track of the
thousand little things that a girl is supposed
not to do. In her lectures to us, which she
gives twice a semester, she declares that
these seeming trifles are neither sins nor
crimes in themselves, but getting into the
habit of yielding to trifles is detrimental to
the development of strong character.
Therefore,&#8221; at this Miss Wilson drew herself
up as tall as possible, and assuming
Miss Morgan&#8217;s best manner continued,
&#8220;trifles must be made subservient to us.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
We must conquer ourselves even in these.&#8221;
Here Miss Wilson laughed merrily. &#8220;Being
late; not having your necktie straight;
letting your shoes run down at the heel;
missing lectures&mdash;these, all these, and hundreds
more, are trifles.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a hurried knock at the door.
Without waiting for an invitation to enter,
a young lady came in. Elizabeth&#8217;s fear of
out-dressing the other girls vanished at the
sight of her. The newcomer was a girl of
slender physique and delicate, regular features.
Her skin was almost olive in hue;
her eyes were dark, with brows so heavy
and black as to be noticeable. They were
too close together and her lips and nostrils
too thin to permit her being beautiful. Her
dress was handsome and showy. It was of
white silk, elaborated with heavy insertions,
and transparent yoke and sleeve-caps made
it suitable for an evening gown. Her
hands were covered with rings scintillating
at every gesture. Each movement of her
body suggested silk linings and petticoats.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
Her manner of speaking had a touch of affectation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Miss Wilson, I&#8217;m awfully sorry to
intrude, but will you be kind enough to hook
my waist? I can&#8217;t reach the last two hooks
on the shoulder. This style of fastening
dresses in the back is such a nuisance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; replied Miss Wilson. Elizabeth
was surprised at the change which came
to her roommate&#8217;s voice. There was neither
vivacity nor good humor in it. It was expressive
of mere icy courtesy.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must bend your knees a little, or
I&#8217;ll be compelled to get on a chair. You&#8217;re
so much taller than I.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl complied. Miss Wilson put the
refractory hooks to their proper use, then
stood quiet. Her guest made some trifling
remark as though to continue the conversation;
but received no encouragement. Her
dark cheeks flushed. &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she began
hurriedly, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to bother you
so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was no bother,&#8221; in the same cold,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
conventional voice. &#8220;I can assist you any
time. I understand how difficult it is to get
into your clothes when you have no roommate
to pull you together.&#8221; Then with a
smile she turned to Elizabeth. &#8220;Come, Miss
Hobart, we must not be late for dinner the
first evening at Exeter.&#8221; So saying, she
held open the door, allowing Elizabeth to
precede her from the room. Miss Wilson
gave no explanation to Elizabeth of her
manner toward the girl; neither did she offer
an excuse for not introducing her. As
they passed the open door, Elizabeth caught
a view of this girl&#8217;s study. It was more
than comfortable. There was a luxury of
soft cushions and rich hangings. There
were chairs and tables of carved wood.</p>
<p>From all the rooms the students came
forth two by two, their tongues flying as they
made their way toward the dining-hall.
There were frequent stops to greet one another,
and a babel of voices expressing
pleasure at this reunion. There were handshakes
for those who were newcomers, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
embraces for old friends. Every one knew
every one else or was going through the first
process of meeting them.</p>
<p>The olive-skinned girl in the handsome
gown came from her room and passed the
others. Each girl was careful to nod and
bid her good-evening, but none greeted her
effusively or even so much as shook hands
with her.</p>
<p>Miss Wilson was not lax in courtesy now.
Drawing her arm through Elizabeth&#8217;s, she
came up to the group of girls at the head
of the main stairway. &#8220;I wish you girls to
meet Miss Hobart,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;so that you
may condole with her. She is to room with
me this semester.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why this semester?&#8221; rejoined a tall girl
in the group as she came forward extending
her hand. &#8220;Why not the year?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She may not survive,&#8221; said Miss Wilson.
&#8220;If she&#8217;s able to stand me one semester,
then she&#8217;ll be compelled to stay the year
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Anna Cresswell,&#8221; continued the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
tall girl to Elizabeth. &#8220;Mary Wilson&#8217;s introductions
leave much to be desired. She
rarely sees fit to mention the names of the
people she introduces.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Stoner and Miss Kean came up at
this juncture. They had changed their
traveling dresses, and were wearing light
challis. They were introduced to Elizabeth,
but neither made mention that they had seen
each other in the car or had come up in the
carriage together. Landis was most demonstrative
in greeting Miss Wilson, chiding
her for not writing during vacation, and
declaring that they must make up for lost
time by spending a great many leisure hours
together now. Miss Wilson laughed merrily.
She had been busy all summer, she
said, and had written only to her own people.
Elizabeth noticed that she expressed
no desire to mortgage her future leisure
hours by any promises.</p>
<p>&#8220;You busy?&#8221; exclaimed Landis. &#8220;Now,
what were you doing&mdash;reading novels, dressing
and driving about?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I should scarcely be content with such
a summer, Landis. No; I played nurse-girl
to Mrs. Gleason&#8217;s large family. I was
busy, too. The place was no sinecure, I assure
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Gleason&mdash;from Gleasonton?&#8221; exclaimed
Min. &#8220;Why, I thought she had no
children.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She hasn&#8217;t&mdash;but she adopts them annually.
During July and August we had a
dozen babies at their home. We went for
them in the morning and took them back at
night, and I gave each one of them a bath
every day.&#8221; This last was said triumphantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard she was rather&mdash;eccentric!&#8221;
said Landis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know her?&#8221; asked Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I do not&mdash;not personally,&#8221; was the
response, &#8220;but we have mutual friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Wilson would have quitted Miss
Stoner and Miss Kean here, but was prevented
by Landis telling her experience that
day in the train, how a woman, a total
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
stranger, had taken her to task for throwing
away her lunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was a common-looking person,&#8221; she
added. &#8220;One could see she belonged to the
middle class, and I suppose had been compelled
to practice economy, so that my
throwing a sandwich away seemed recklessly
extravagant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you think she was common-looking?&#8221;
asked Elizabeth. &#8220;Her skin was as
fine as a baby&#8217;s, and her eyes were beautiful.
Didn&#8217;t you see how expressive they were?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t. All I could see was her
gingham shirtwaist suit with its prudish
white linen cuffs and collar, and her rough
straw hat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Wilson put her arm through her
roommate&#8217;s to hurry her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse us, girls, if we walk faster; I
wish Miss Hobart to meet Nancy. She&#8217;s
the girl ahead with Anna Cresswell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth was borne along toward the dining-hall,
at the door of which Miss Cresswell
and her companion stopped.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Nancy, I wish you and Miss Hobart to
meet,&#8221; said Miss Wilson, &#8220;and I intend
that you shall be good friends. Nancy
and I were brought up together, and she&#8217;s
used to me. When you want anyone to sympathize
with you because of me, go to
Nancy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her name is Miss Eckdahl,&#8221; added Miss
Cresswell with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;But she should have known. Everyone
should know Nancy without being told.
What is the good of being famous otherwise?
If your name goes not abroad, what
is the good of being a champion in mathematics
or anything else? When I say
&#8216;Nancy,&#8217; the intelligent person should know
that I mean&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nancy Hanks,&#8221; added the girl herself.
&#8220;I might be mistaken for the famous
trotter.&#8221;</p>
<p>So chatting, they entered the dining-hall.
Tables set for six each filled the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Cresswell, will you take charge of
Elizabeth&mdash;I&#8217;m going to call you Elizabeth;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
you don&#8217;t look nearly old enough to be Miss
Hobart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; come with me, Miss Hobart.
Nancy, I presume you and I part here. I
shall be surprised if Miss Morgan permits
you and Mary to be together much longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>She led the way to a table by the window
where she seated herself at its head, placing
Elizabeth at her right.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Morgan never allows roommates to
sit together at meals,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;or
two girls who have been reared together as
Mary and Nancy have. She wishes us to
know all the students, and tries to prevent
our forming little cliques, as we&#8217;re bound
to do when we room and eat and study with
the same people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what if you should not like the other
people?&#8221; asked Elizabeth. &#8220;It must be
rather unpleasant to sit at meals with someone
whom you do not like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is one of the lessons Miss Morgan
is giving us the opportunity of learning.
We may discover on close acquaintance that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
one is more likable than we first supposed;
and if that is impossible, then we learn to
keep our dislikes to ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dining-hall was rapidly filling. Landis
Stoner and Min Kean came in among
the last, the former taking her place at Miss
Cresswell&#8217;s table, sitting beside Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Anna Cresswell,&#8221; she exclaimed,
leaning forward, &#8220;did Miss Morgan put you
at the head of the table?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How else should I be here? You surely
did not think I came unasked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, I spoke without thinking. Of
course, you would not come unless she asked
you to do so. I was surprised, that was
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why surprised? You know I am a
Senior, and it is customary to give them the
head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, of course. But there are Seniors
who haven&#8217;t been given the head.
That is what made me speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Cresswell turned the conversation to
other subjects. Elizabeth was the only new
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
student at the table. She felt that some reason
other than the one given had caused
Miss Stoner to speak as she had. It was not
until some days later that she learned that
Landis was a Senior. She learned, too,
that the girl was ambitious to be first, even
in so slight a thing as sitting at the head
of a table and playing hostess to five girls,
generally of under classes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you on the second floor again this
year, Landis?&#8221; asked a little pink-and-white,
china-doll girl from the foot of the
table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mame. Min and I have the same
rooms as before. The third time is the
charm. I presume something good will
happen this year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps Min will get through the preliminaries,&#8221;
was the rejoinder. &#8220;She won&#8217;t
pull through from any effort she makes herself.
If her friends wish to see her graduate,
they will be compelled to resort to something.
Get her to pick four-leafed clovers
and wear them in the toe of her shoe, possibly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
That has been known to work where
all else fails.&#8221;</p>
<p>Landis looked serious at the jest. Her
manner grew quite self-assertive as she replied,
as though expressing herself quite settled
the question. Yet throughout there
was an assumed self-deprecatory air, as
though she would not have her hearers think
she was either maligning her friend or lauding
herself too highly in the comparison
suggested in her speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t blame Min too much. Some work
which would be possible for you or me, is
impossible for her. I did not realize until
we roomed together what a difference there
can be in&mdash;in&mdash;minds. I could not have believed
that any one would consider a theorem
or a page of French difficult. But,&#8221;
with an arch glance, &#8220;these past two years
have taught me a great deal. I am more
sympathetic, and oh so much more thankful
that I am&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not as &#8216;<i>these</i> publicans and sinners,&#8217;&#8221;
finished the girl at the foot. As she spoke,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
her glance swept over the table to include
among &#8220;these&#8221; all who sat there.</p>
<p>Even Elizabeth, though a stranger, could
not suppress a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who has No. 12&mdash;that big room, the one
Miss Watson used to have?&#8221; continued Miss
Welch, ignoring Landis&#8217; show of vexation
at her words. Landis made no attempt to
answer, although the question was addressed
to her. After a moment&#8217;s silence, a little
German girl, Elizabeth&#8217;s vis-a-vis, replied,
&#8220;If I have not heard it unright, Fraulein&mdash;that
is, Miss O&#8217;Day in it she will
room.&#8221;</p>
<p>She blushed prettily as she spoke, half in
shyness and half in embarrassment that her
German idioms would intrude themselves
when she was trying to speak English. She
looked up at Miss Cresswell, as though she
sought encouragement from her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Miss Hirsch, what have you been
doing all summer? Spending all your vacation
talking English? You have improved
wonderfully. Now Fraulein Kronenberg
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
will complain that you are losing
your pure German accent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, think you so? It is glad I am. A
single German word the whole long summer
have I not said. But about the room which
on the second floor is; to me it was said Miss
O&#8217;Day will&mdash;will&mdash;occupy? it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is to room with her?&#8221; asked Miss
Welch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe she is to room alone,&#8221; said Miss
Cresswell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t Maud Harris go back with
her? They seemed to get along well last
fall, and Maud is well enough to enter
again!&#8221; said Miss Welch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Harris with anything could&mdash;what
you call it?&mdash;get along,&#8221; said Miss Hirsch.</p>
<p>&#8220;My words seem to suggest that Miss
O&#8217;Day is difficult to get along with. I did
not mean that. So far as I know, she has
a very even temper, and is more than generous
with all her possessions. She isn&#8217;t
selfish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can plainly see why Maud has another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
roommate. Of course you all do. It does
seem a little hard.&#8221; Here Landis&#8217; manner
grew important. Her head was raised, and
her lips curled. &#8220;But those of us who have
a high sense of honor would not care to room
with Miss O&#8217;Day. I hope I am not narrow-minded,
but I feel that all my finer instincts
rebel at the thought of&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Stoner, if you please, we will drop
the subject. Nothing can be gained by
carrying it further.&#8221; This came from Miss
Cresswell. She spoke quietly but her manner
and voice was that of one who expected
to have her suggestions followed.</p>
<p>Landis tilted her head a little higher, but
her face flushed. She was about to tell Miss
Cresswell that she would discuss any subject
when and where she chose when she remembered
suddenly that Miss Cresswell was the
head of the table and the one to whom she
must pay a certain amount of respect.</p>
<p>The dinner had been brought in. Miss
Cresswell served the plates with Maggie, the
colored serving-maid, standing at her side.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
All conversation of a personal nature
stopped while the servants were in the room.
When the dinner was over, and dessert on
the table, the chatter began. As they were
about to quit the room, a bell rang. Quiet
fell upon them. Dr. Morgan arose from her
place at the head table.</p>
<p>She made a few general announcements.
Then in her clear, decisive voice continued:
&#8220;The students will not forget that they are
expected to dress for dinner. If you are too
indisposed to change your school attire for
something fresher, you are too indisposed to
come to the dining-hall. But you will bear
in mind that this does not mean either dinner
or reception gowns. Elaborate and extravagant
dressing is not suited to girls in
school. Miss O&#8217;Day has infringed upon this
rule. Consequently she may pass immediately
to her apartments, change her gown,
and spend the evening in her room, without
conversing with anyone. You may be
excused, Miss O&#8217;Day.&#8221;</p>
<p>From a table at a distant part of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
room, Miss O&#8217;Day arose. As she moved
through the room with her head high and
eyes straight before her, her shoulders
and arms gleamed through their transparent
covering, and the rustle of her silken
petticoats was audible.</p>
<p>As she disappeared, Dr. Morgan gave the
signal for dismissal. The hum of conversation
among the students began again, as in
little groups they passed to the parlors or
to the campus.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>THE RECEPTION.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;What have you brought to fix up our
quarters?&#8221; asked Miss Wilson, the day following
Elizabeth&#8217;s arrival at Exeter. Her
trunk and box were in the middle of the
study, while she and Miss Wilson stood and
looked on as Jimmy Jordan unfastened
straps and drew out nails.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; was the reply.
&#8220;Mother slipped in a whole box of extras.
I wondered why she was doing it. She said
I would see later. There were cups and
spoons, and doilies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sensible mother,&#8221; rejoined Miss Wilson.
&#8220;She realizes the necessity of frequent
spreads in the strenuous life we lead. No
doubt we&#8217;ll find among your traps a glass or
so of jelly, and some preserves. Mothers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
who have been at school themselves appreciate
the situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth laughed. She was beginning to
understand her roommate&#8217;s style of conversation.</p>
<p>Miss Wilson was not one to shirk. Work
had no terrors for her. She was never idle,
but when she was tired with study she found
rest in some other form of occupation. Now,
while Elizabeth was unpacking, she assisted
her in every way, putting in order bureau
drawers, and arranging books.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had depended more or less upon
her mother. How much that &#8220;more&#8221; was
greater than that &#8220;less&#8221; she did not realize
until she was alone. Miss Wilson proved
her right hand now.</p>
<p>The greater part of the day was spent in
arranging their possessions. The pictures
which Elizabeth had brought from home
were hung; the bright cushions placed at a
proper angle on the couch, over which had
been placed a covering of gay tapestry. A
table had been drawn up near the fireplace.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></p>
<p>This was a new experience for Elizabeth
so she let Miss Wilson take the lead. She
watched her arrange the tea-table. The
dainty cups and plates, souvenir spoons,
sugar bowl and creamer found their proper
places. It was a small edition of their dining-table
at home. The chafing-dish and
swinging kettle with its alcohol lamp were
too much for Elizabeth to bear without comment.
She must and did ask their purpose.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you in one minute,&#8221; said Mary.
She took a box of cocoa and a bottle of alcohol
from a small cabinet. &#8220;I must borrow
some cream from Anna Cresswell. I
saw her get some this morning. But first
I must put this water on to boil.&#8221; She did
so, then hurried from the room, soon returning
with the cream.</p>
<p>After stirring the cream, cocoa and sugar
in the cup, she poured on the boiling water.
With a few additional manipulations of the
spoon, she held out the cup to Elizabeth.
&#8220;Here, girlie, drink to the prosperity of Exeter
Hall in general, and these quarters in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
particular. May you get along with your
roommate better than people generally do,
and may all the scraps between you and her
be made up before the retiring-bell rings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth raised her cup to the toast, then
drank. &#8220;Why, that is fine&mdash;and made with
such a little fire! I would not have believed
it possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think that is good?&#8221; was the reply.
&#8220;You will open your eyes when you see what
can be done with the chafing-dish,&mdash;creamed
oysters, fudge, soups of all kinds, Welsh
rarebits. I hope, Elizabeth, that you spoke
to your mother about boxes. At Exeter,
boxes are acceptable at all times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boxes?&#8221; in surprise. &#8220;No; I never
mentioned the word to her. I didn&#8217;t understand
that they would be required. The
catalog made no mention of them. I know
because I looked particularly about the number
of napkins and towels required. What
do you <i>put in</i> them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. It is what you <i>take out</i>
of them that makes them valuable. Personally,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
I prefer roast chicken and cake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried Elizabeth. &#8220;How dull I am!
But you know that I was never before at
any school, and I never knew any girls my
own age.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll teach you a lot,&#8221; was the response.</p>
<p>&#8220;You and father agree in that. He says
that the students will teach me more than the
faculty. But that is one of the things I cannot
understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will sometime. I wouldn&#8217;t bother
my head much about it now. What do you
think about this Gibson head? It doesn&#8217;t
fit in here with the other pictures.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me try it on this side of the room,&#8221;
Elizabeth replied, placing the picture at a
better angle.</p>
<p>So the day progressed in doing a score of
little odds and ends of work which have the
effect of making boarding-school quarters
suggestive of home.</p>
<p>Several weeks later Elizabeth had one lesson
in what the girls could teach her, something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
which was not found between the
covers of books. At home, there had always
been her mother to pick up after her. She
might drop hat, gloves and coat anywhere
about the house, and when she needed them,
find them in their proper places, dusted,
mended and ready for use.</p>
<p>During the first week at Exeter, Mary
Wilson unconsciously dropped into her
mother&#8217;s place in this particular, perhaps
because she was a year older than Elizabeth,
and had learned this lesson in her own time.
Certain it was, when they dressed for dinner,
she looked about the bedroom and put
in order each article which was out of place,
or called Elizabeth&#8217;s shortcomings to notice
with, &#8220;Your dress will muss lying on that
chair,&#8221; or &#8220;Is that your slipper in the study,
or did I leave mine there?&#8221;</p>
<p>During the month of October, the girls
at Exeter gave their first reception. Guests
came from all the little towns about, and the
Hall was filled with flowers, lights and
bright music.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>Elizabeth and Mary had hurried from the
dinner-table to get into their party gowns.
Miss Wilson, as a Senior, was one of the reception-committee.
Elizabeth was but half-way
through with her dressing when Mary
had finished.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, Elizabeth, I&#8217;m done. Look me
over and see if my waist is together all
right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth was standing before the mirror,
pins between her lips, trying to reduce a refractory
bow to submission. She turned to
look at her roommate. &#8220;Sweet&mdash;your dress
is beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; was the response with a
characteristic toss of her head. &#8220;With
those pins in your mouth you talk like a
dialect story. I&#8217;m off now. Dr. Morgan
wishes the committee to meet in her parlor.
I suppose she wants to get our mouths
into the &#8216;papa, potatoes, prunes and prisms&#8217;
shape before we meet the guests. I&#8217;m sorry
I can&#8217;t go down with you, Elizabeth. A
first reception is so trying. Nancy won&#8217;t go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
down until late. Suppose I ask her to wait
for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That may put her to trouble. I thought
of asking Miss O&#8217;Day to go with me. She&#8217;s
just across the hall, and has no one special
to go with her since she rooms alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Wilson hesitated a moment, standing
in the middle of the doorway. She looked
quite serious at the mention of Miss O&#8217;Day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss O&#8217;Day might&mdash;not like to be
bothered. Besides, you do not know her
very well. I&#8217;ll send Nancy.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that she disappeared.</p>
<p>As the gaslight in the bedroom was not
satisfactory Elizabeth went into the sitting-room
or study, as the students were accustomed
to call it, to finish her dressing.
Nancy came to the door just as Elizabeth put
on the last touches.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be late,&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;I think
it&#8217;s fun to go early and meet all the strangers.
Judge Wilson and his friends will be
here if the train was on time at Ridgway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth caught up her fan and handkerchief
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
and started forth. Her attention was
claimed by the curious fan Nancy carried.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is odd, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; exclaimed Nancy,
unfurling it. &#8220;It is hand-carved. You
know the Swedes are famous for that kind
of work. This is quite old. My grandfather
made it for my grandmother when
they were sweethearts over in Sweden.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked her surprise at this statement.
Her companion noticed her expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;You knew, of course, that I was of
Swedish birth!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I did not. I knew that you made
your home with Miss Wilson&#8217;s family. I
took it for granted that you must be a relative.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not the least bit,&#8221; was the response,
given without a show of embarrassment.
&#8220;I&#8217;m merely a dependent. My father was a
Swedish minister, and worked among our
people near the Wilson home. When he
died, we were left with nothing to live on.
Mother did sewing for the Swedish people.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
I was very strong and quite as able to work
as she. So I went to live at the Wilson
home where I helped with the little children
and also went to school. I grew to love
them, and they seemed to really care for me.
When I finished the high school, Mrs. Wilson
sent me here. I&#8217;m to be a teacher after
I graduate at Exeter. I always count the
Wilson home mine. Each summer I go back
there and help with the children while Mrs.
Wilson takes a vacation.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not add that she had shown such
an aptitude for study, and had proved so
efficient and trustworthy that Mrs. Wilson
had decided to give her the best advantages
to fit her for a profession.</p>
<p>As they passed the open door of the room
occupied by Landis Stoner and Min Kean,
the voices of the girls came to them. They
had evidently taken it for granted that the
other students had gone to the parlors and
that there wasn&#8217;t anyone to hear the conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, for my part, Min,&#8221; Landis was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
saying, &#8220;I do not think you look at all well
in that blue silk. You look so sallow. You
are so much sweeter in your white organdy
with your pink sash.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Landis, I&#8217;ve worn it so often.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But not here. It will be new to the
girls, and it looks perfectly fresh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You said you liked the blue silk when I
was buying it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did and I do yet, but it isn&#8217;t suited to
you. Now for me, it would be all right,
but&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d come down, Landis. I always
have a better time when you are
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I? I haven&#8217;t a dress for a reception.
You simply cannot get a dress
made at home fit to wear, and my staying up
in the country all summer with you made
my going to the city impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was all that reached the girls in the
hall, and this was forced upon them.
Nancy could not forbear a smile. Elizabeth
with the guilelessness of an unexperienced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
child exclaimed, &#8220;Why, Landis seems
to have so many beautiful clothes. Her
father must be very wealthy. Her rings
and pins are simply lovely. Isn&#8217;t that a
diamond she wears?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but it&#8217;s Min&#8217;s. Landis has been
wearing it for the last two years. Min is an
only child. She has no mother and her
father, who is a millionaire oil-man, allows
her to spend what she pleases.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Landis&#8217; father an oil-man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he isn&#8217;t,&#8221; was the reply.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was learning how much could
be said by silence. During her short acquaintance
with Landis, the girl had suggested
many of the possibilities of her
future&mdash;a cruise on a private yacht, a year&#8217;s
study and travel in Europe. She had not
said that money was no consideration with
her, yet Elizabeth had gained such an impression
from her words.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry Landis will miss the reception,&#8221;
she said.</p>
<p>Nancy smiled. &#8220;She will not miss it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
She enjoys the social side of school life too
much to miss anything of this kind. She
will be down after awhile.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you heard what she said&mdash;that she
had nothing fit to wear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she will have&mdash;or has now. She
will appear in a gown that puts all other
dresses in the shade. Here we are. How
fine the reception committee look. Poor
Mary Wilson! this is hard for her. She&#8217;s
doing her best not to toss back her hair and
laugh.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she spoke, they entered the parlors.
Jimmy Jordan, arrayed in full dress, announced
their arrival to Dr. Morgan.</p>
<p>The girls maintained a dignified and elegant
composure until they reached the end
of the line where Miss Wilson stood.
Nancy&#8217;s appearance distracted her attention
from her social duties.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got too much powder on your
nose, Nancy,&#8221; and with a flutter of her
handkerchief, she made Nancy presentable.
Then she remembered where she was. Her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
face flushed. She looked about her. Her
words had carried across the room. The
smiles of the committee about her were almost
audible.</p>
<p>Elizabeth in company with Nancy moved
through the room. &#8220;Here is someone I
wish you to meet,&#8221; said Nancy, &#8220;that is, if
you are really interested in people of strong,
though peculiar character. She is a Miss
Rice. She owns a little farm not far from
where my father preached. She works the
whole place herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>They came up to Miss Rice, a woman far
past middle age. Her features showed exposure
to the sun. Her red-bronze hair was
turning into a grizzled, faded gray.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to meet Miss Hobart,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;You are from Bitumen, I hear. I have
planned to go there as soon as I get my potatoes
in, and those odd chores done for the
winter. I heard your father had a peculiar
plant&mdash;something unusual hereabout.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth repeated the story of his having
found an odd seed in an importation of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
tea and having planted it. Miss Rice&#8217;s conversation
was interesting. Her voice was
full and melodious, but even Elizabeth who
was used to the eccentricities of Miss Hale&#8217;s
attire could not repress a smile.</p>
<p>Miss Rice talked of the wheat blight and
the damaging effects of potato-bugs, then
with equal interest quoted Browning, and
debated the question whether there was a
present-day literature worthy of the name.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a quaint character,&#8221; Miss Cresswell
said later to Elizabeth. &#8220;She might
have been independently rich, but she has no
idea of the value of money, and she is the
sort who always finds someone who needs it
more than she. It&#8217;s been years since she&#8217;s
had a respectable winter coat because she
pledged herself to provide for several old
ladies in the Home for the Friendless. She
has a whole host of doless relatives, whom
she props up whenever they need it, and,&#8221; as
though an afterthought, &#8220;they always need
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know if Landis is coming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
down?&#8221; asked Miss Rice a few moments
later, turning to Elizabeth. &#8220;I really came
purposely to see her. We&#8217;ve been a little
uncertain about her finishing the year, but
last week I sold four hundred bushels of potatoes.
That means she can stay. She&#8217;ll be
pleased, but no more than I&#8217;ll be.&#8221; Then in
a confidential tone, &#8220;When I was a girl, I
didn&#8217;t have the advantages that I&#8217;m trying
to give Landis. We were poor, and father
and mother were getting on in years, and
I couldn&#8217;t leave them. What I learned I
dug out of books and other people&#8217;s minds.
Julia Hale&mdash;you know her&mdash;got me interested
in botany, and someone else came along
with a book or so. I was ambitious to go to
Exeter, and then be a missionary. That
seemed to be such a beautiful life of self-sacrifice;
but it seems it wasn&#8217;t to be. There
never was a day when someone right there at
home didn&#8217;t need me, so that after a while I
didn&#8217;t ever have time to think of going. But
there was Landis. I mean to prepare her
well and send her in my place. When the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
potatoes turned out better than I&#8217;d been
counting on, I just sat down and laughed.
Then I got ready and came down here to tell
Landis. There she is now.&#8221; She arose, a
trace of pleasurable excitement showing in
her manner and lighting up her weather-beaten
face, and moved to where Landis,
radiant and self-confident, stood with Min
and others of her satellites.</p>
<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s eyes followed. She gave a
little start of surprise at the sight. Min
was wearing an organdy plainly showing
signs of service, while Landis was arrayed
in a handsome gown of soft blue silk. Elizabeth
knew not the reason for it, but as she
looked at the girls she had a sensation of being
out-of-sorts, and at variance with the
world. She might have given up to her
feelings had not her roommate joined her.
Mary&#8217;s eyes were a little brighter than
usual. She was fairly bubbling over with
excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been looking almost everywhere for
you, Elizabeth,&#8221; she cried, tucking her hand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
within Elizabeth&#8217;s arm, and leading her into
a small room adjoining. &#8220;I want you to
meet the best father and mother this country
ever produced.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve met them,&#8221; responded Elizabeth.
&#8220;They are in Bitumen at this minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary laughed and gave her arm a
squeeze. &#8220;You&#8217;re getting on, Elizabeth.
A month ago you couldn&#8217;t have made such
a remark. You were too literally literal.
But as to the best parents; I have them shut
up in this room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not my parents,&#8221; decidedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say not. My own. Why
should I be wanting anyone&#8217;s else?&#8221;</p>
<p>They entered the room where a little
group of the older guests had gathered.
Leading Elizabeth to her father and mother,
&#8220;This is Elizabeth,&#8221; Mary said. Both
father and mother held out their hands to
her. Elizabeth felt that they were not
strangers. They knew of her father. She
was very glad to note the tone in which all
people spoke of him. Nothing was said of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
his being a brilliant man, although he had
been that, but all spoke of him as a good
man and doing good work.</p>
<p>&#8220;The liquor people are getting it strong
up your way, Judge,&#8221; said a little old man
in the group. &#8220;What is going to happen
to our friend Bill?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It has happened,&#8221; responded Mr. Wilson.
&#8220;We finished him Friday morning&mdash;a
year and six months in the workhouse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked about her in surprise.
Miss Cresswell was near her. &#8220;Is Mary
Wilson&#8217;s father that famous Judge Wilson?&#8221;
she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, didn&#8217;t you know it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth shook her head slowly. &#8220;How
should I know?&#8221; she said, sinking back into
her chair as though overcome by the news.
&#8220;No one told me,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;and
Mary herself never mentioned it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should she?&#8221; was the response.
&#8220;She is so used to his honors that she thinks
nothing at all about them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it strange,&#8221; said Elizabeth, having
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
slowly awakened to the condition of affairs
in the little world about her, &#8220;that it seems
to be the people who have the least and do
the least that make the most fuss?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing Exeter has taught you?&#8221; said
Miss Cresswell with a smile. &#8220;The little
tugs must make a noise or they may be run
down, but the big liners are confident of
their own power and so is everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Elizabeth had not heard this last remark.
She was leaning eagerly forward
listening to the conversation among the
others. Judge Wilson was explaining to
those who were interested what Big Bill
Kyler had done to justify a year and a half
in jail.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; the Judge said, &#8220;all the land
at Italee and Gleasonton belong to Mrs.
Gleason. She won&#8217;t sell, and leases and
rents only under certain conditions. All
renters are her husband&#8217;s workmen. I suppose
there&#8217;s seven or eight hundred in the
tannery and brickyard. She won&#8217;t permit
a licensed hotel on her land. Big Bill
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
drives across the country, loads his wagon
with contraband goods and retails them
from his house. This is all on the quiet. I
reckon he&#8217;s carried this on for six months.
But some time in August, Mrs. Gleason had
his wagon stopped with the result,&#8221; with a
wave of his hand, &#8220;Bill is living at the expense
of the State.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A pretty smart woman, Mrs. Gleason.&#8221;
This remark came from the little old man
in the corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very, but she would never have discovered
this if someone had not given her a
pointer; for Big Bill outwardly was an advocate
of temperance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am out of patience with the way in
which justice errs,&#8221; cried Mrs. Wilson, in
the same spirited, sprightly way her daughter
might have done. &#8220;We all know that
Big Bill is not accountable. He has always
been the tool of anyone who would make use
of him. I doubt if he made any money by
this work. There was a shrewder man
back of him who planned this and took the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
money. And that man is the one who
should be punished.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly,&#8221; responded the Judge.
&#8220;But that man is shrewd enough to keep
himself out of the toils. He has a wholesale
license to sell at Westport. He does
not obligate himself to question his buyers.
He may ask Big Bill a trifle more than
anyone else, but that is no infringement of
the law. I think there was no doubt in anyone&#8217;s
mind who was the instigator of this
&#8216;speak-easy&#8217; business at Italee; but he was
shrewd enough to keep within the letter of
the law. We could not touch him, and he
knew it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole business is nefarious! It is
the curse of our country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judge Wilson smiled back at his wife.
She was always so decided in her opinions,
so fearless in expressing them.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure, to be sure,&#8221; he responded
calmly. &#8220;Most of us acknowledge that, but
we have power only to interpret and judge.
The people make the laws.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think this talk is a trifle too heavy for
a boarding-school reception,&#8221; exclaimed a
young matron. &#8220;I shall return to the
reception hall and listen to the chatter of
schoolgirls. I haven&#8217;t outgrown my taste
for it.&#8221; She laughed and passed into the
adjoining room.</p>
<p>Her remark lead to the general breaking
up of the little group. &#8220;We had better go
back to the younger set,&#8221; was the sentiment
of the elders.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must slip up now and see how nice
our rooms look,&#8221; cried Mary Wilson, clinging
to her father and mother. &#8220;Elizabeth
brought so many pretty things from home,
our rooms look quite fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; do come,&#8221; said Elizabeth. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
make you a cup of cocoa&mdash;or Mary will. I
haven&#8217;t reached such a high state of perfection
that I make it for company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, just, for one moment then,&#8221; said
Mrs. Wilson. &#8220;We must not stay long
enough to be missed. Mrs. Williams, will
you and your husband come with us? We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
are going up to see the girls&#8217; rooms. They
tell me that they are very fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Williams gladly accepted. She was
a little old Quaker lady, in Quaker garb,
neat as the proverbial pin, and with the
appearance of having just stepped from
some old painting.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been so many years since I have
seen a schoolgirl&#8217;s room,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that I
should love to see Mary&#8217;s. In my day ours
were plain&mdash;painted floors and wooden beds.
It was not allowable to have aught else; but
we were taught to be orderly&mdash;too much so,
I thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Morgan is particular about that.
Mrs. Schuyler is preceptress, but she works
under Dr. Morgan&#8217;s orders,&#8221; said Mrs. Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is well. Book knowledge means
little if a woman is untidy and careless,&#8221;
was the response.</p>
<p>Elizabeth and Mary, far in the rear, acting
as body-guard to the Judge, did not hear
these remarks on neatness. To Mary it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
would have mattered little, for her conscience
was clear so far as keeping her possessions
in order was concerned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, father, wait just one second,&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;There is Miss Watson from
Muncy. I must speak with her, and ask her
to go with us. She was at a German University
all last year.&#8221; She hurried away,
and soon returned with a distinguished-looking
young woman whom she introduced
as Miss Watson. &#8220;She is going up with
us,&#8221; explained Miss Wilson, &#8220;to have a cup
of cocoa. Oh, yes,&#8221; as Miss Watson was
about to demur, &#8220;we have eight cups now.
Do you remember the time two years ago
when I invited the girls in and forgot that
I hadn&#8217;t dishes enough? Yes; I have the
same rooms but they&#8217;re much nicer. We
have so many new things that I&#8217;m sure you
will not recognize them. Miss Hobart is
my roommate. We have gotten along
famously so far&mdash;haven&#8217;t had the smallest
kind of a difficulty. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll so continue,
for I always think the first month is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
the hardest. We had to learn to adjust ourselves
to each other. But there is no danger
of a quarrel now. We have passed our
rocks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Knock on wood, Mary,&#8221; called back her
father on hearing the remark, &#8220;that will
exorcise the evil spirit of assurance.
Knock on wood, I say, or you and Elizabeth
will quarrel before the week is out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary tossed her head and laughed. She
thoroughly appreciated her father&#8217;s witticisms.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not knock on wood&mdash;and we will
not quarrel,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;That is our
room, mother. Yes; right there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Williams and Mrs. Wilson passed
into the bedroom. The others of the party
followed. Elizabeth and Mary at the end
of the line had stepped aside to give precedence
to the elders.</p>
<p>They heard Judge Wilson laugh. &#8220;It
has been nothing less than a cyclone,&#8221; he
said, then laughed again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, this is not at all like Mary!&#8221; began
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
Mrs. Wilson. Mary noticed the tone
of apology in her voice.</p>
<p>She and Elizabeth stepped inside. Elizabeth&#8217;s
face grew crimson. In the middle of
the floor lay her school shoes which, in her
haste to dress, she had kicked off and left.
Her coat and hat were on one chair.
Stretched out on the end of the couch was
her gym suit, glaringly conspicuous with its
crimson braid. Every toilet article that she
had used was in evidence, and in a place
never designed for its occupancy.</p>
<p>Miss Wilson arose to the occasion. With
a characteristic toss of the head, she crossed
the room and drew forward a chair. &#8220;Sit,
all of you, and I&#8217;ll put the kettle to boil for
cocoa. Father, tell your story about the
boy illustrating &#8216;The Old Oaken Bucket.&#8217;&#8221;
She lighted the alcohol lamp while she was
talking. She made no apology for the disorder
of the room. One might suppose
from her manner that all was as the most
fastidious might desire.</p>
<p>Elizabeth sat quietly in the background,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
hoping that no one would speak to her.
Her face was burning. There was a dimness
about her eyes suggestive of tears.</p>
<p>Missing her, Mrs. Wilson turned, about.
&#8220;Where is Elizabeth?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Did
she not come with us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I came,&#8221; said a voice choking with
tears. &#8220;I&#8217;m here&mdash;and oh, I am so
ashamed. Not one of those articles scattered
about are Mary&#8217;s. They&#8217;re all mine.&#8221;
At this she could no longer restrain herself,
but began to cry.</p>
<p>Both Mrs. Williams and Mrs. Wilson
would have consoled her with well chosen
words of sympathy. The men laughed and
declared that they were so accustomed to
dropping their shoes in the middle of the
floor that they had not recognized the signs
of disorder; that they supposed that the
floor was the legitimate place for shoes.
But treating the matter lightly did not rid
Elizabeth of her shame and embarrassment.
She was unable to control herself. Slipping
into the bedroom, she threw herself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
face downward on the pillow and sobbed
herself to sleep.</p>
<p>When she awakened, she found that the
guests and Miss Wilson had departed. She
prepared for bed and was standing in her
night clothes when Mary came back into the
room, a tearful little maiden. But Miss
Wilson was unmoved.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry and&mdash;ashamed,&#8221; began
Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;You should be,&#8221; was the unfeeling response.</p>
<p>&#8220;It shall never happen so again,&#8221; contritely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure it will not, for after this I&#8217;ll
see to it that the room is in order after you
get through dressing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mary, don&#8217;t be so hard. Won&#8217;t
you forgive me? I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m ashamed
enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is no use talking further about it,&#8221;
was the grim response. &#8220;The thing&#8217;s done
and cannot be undone by any amount of
talking. You mortified me before my best
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
friends, and I can not forget it soon.
When I can, I&#8217;ll tell you. But please don&#8217;t
mention the subject to me again.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was all, but it was enough. Elizabeth
crept into bed and turned her face to
the wall. She had no desire to cry now.
Anger and grief were holding equal places
with her.</p>
<p>She was too young and healthy and sleepy
to stay awake long. She had been sleeping
uneasily when she awoke from a horrible
nightmare. She had dreamed that a most
formidable array of shoes and stockings,
hats and coats in the form of grinning spectres
were hovering about her ready to seize
her. When she was wide awake, she remembered
the cause of her dream. She remembered,
too, that she had not put the
sitting-room in order.</p>
<p>Crawling softly from bed, she crept into
the study. It seemed as though each chair,
in a conspiracy to make her efforts difficult,
stood in her path. She turned on the gas
and gathered together her possessions.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
Then she crept back to her nest again, hoping
that the spectres of her negligence
would not haunt her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>A BOX FROM HOME.</h3>
</div>

<p>For some days the relations between Elizabeth
and her roommate were strained.
No further words concerning the order of
the room passed between them, but each
time they dressed, whether for breakfast or
dinner, Miss Wilson made a point of looking
about both rooms to see that each article
was as it should be. The very calmness of
her manner was exasperating. Elizabeth
was hurt more by it than by words. She
paid no attention to Mary&#8217;s vain efforts, for
they had grown to be vain, as Elizabeth was
keeping the tightest kind of a rein on herself.</p>
<p>Each article of dress was hung in its proper
place as it left her hand. Each pencil
went back to the pencil-holder even when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
she intended using it in a few minutes.
She did not grant herself a second&#8217;s grace.
Her efforts were untiring during the first
and second week. Many times she went
back from the door of the class-room to be
sure that every article in her room was
where it should be.</p>
<p>Gradually she formed the habit of being
orderly. It was but a few weeks until she
discovered that she put her clothes away
without thinking about it. She discovered,
too, that she was actually saving time in not
having to hunt for anything.</p>
<p>Mrs. Schuyler, the preceptress, generally
looked in upon the rooms while the girls
were at class. She was a dainty little widow,
with a manner which she supposed to
be pleasant and ingratiating but which the
girls termed monotonously servile. Her
expression was so exceedingly pleasant that
the students named her Mrs. Smiles.</p>
<p>One Saturday morning as she made her
daily rounds, she found both Elizabeth and
Mary in their rooms.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Hobart, I must speak with you,&#8221;
she said, sweeping in, the long train of her
black house gown trailing after her. &#8220;I
wish to commend you on the improvement
you have made in keeping your apartments
in order. It has been weeks since I have
found an article out of place on your dresser;
and your closet has been in excellent
order.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are very kind to tell me so,&#8221; was
the response. &#8220;But I take little credit to
myself for the improvement. I&#8217;ve had
such an example and mentor always before
me that I could scarce be anything else but
improved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Wilson stood by but gave no indication
of hearing the remark until Mrs.
Smiles, smiling and bowing, dragged her
train from the room. Then she turned to
Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I scarcely expect you&#8217;ll forgive me
for the way I spoke that evening. But
I was provoked and&mdash;and&mdash;humiliated.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
Miss Watson has always been my ideal and
I did wish her to see me at my best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think she did. You were all that could
be expected of a girl. The Sphinx itself,
could not have been more outwardly calm.
I fancy Miss Watson went away in admiration
of your self-control. If I remember,
I was the only one who appeared to disadvantage.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a trace of bitterness in the
girl&#8217;s voice, for in spite of her effort to forget,
the hurt of that evening still rankled
within her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Elizabeth, please do not speak in
that tone. I was sorry for my words that
evening the moment I spoke. But I am
hasty. I try my best to keep quiet when
I&#8217;m angry; but now and then I express myself
before I realize it. You can&#8217;t expect
perfection in anyone. A quick temper is
my besetting sin. I try to overcome it; but
until I do my friends must bear with me.
No one is perfection.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; was the reply, &#8220;I&#8217;m rather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
surprised that you hold such an opinion.
From the way you spoke that evening,
I could not have judged you to be so liberal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Wilson knew her words were
wasted. With a quick, impulsive movement
she crossed the room to where Elizabeth
stood, and throwing her arms about
her, cried out, &#8220;You must not talk like that,
Elizabeth. You are not naturally sarcastic.
Let me be the disagreeable one&mdash;if one there
must be.&#8221;</p>
<p>She drew Elizabeth&#8217;s head down, kissing
her warmly. It was impossible to be vexed
long with such a whole-souled, impulsive
girl as Miss Wilson. Elizabeth smiled and
relented. From that time matters between
the two moved smoothly as at first; but
Elizabeth did not relax her vigilance. She
realized how others might be inconvenienced
and mortified by her carelessness.
From an economical point of view, too, it
was better to reform; for she had lost much
time, and been tardy at class frequently on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
account of having to hunt for some needed
article.</p>
<p>This week proved to be one of the most
eventful of Elizabeth&#8217;s school year. She
did not plan to go home for Thanksgiving.
The Saturday previous she received a box
from her mother. It was filled with all the
good things a mother&#8217;s heart could devise
and a cook&#8217;s skillful hands make ready.
Miss Wilson carried the news of the arrival
of the box to Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;The expressman&#8217;s on his way up with
an immense box,&#8221; she cried, tossing back
her hair, and talking as excitedly as though
Exeter Hall were governed by a Board of
Starvation.</p>
<p>Elizabeth hurried to the door. The
expressman was already there, with about
as much as he could carry.</p>
<p>Mary, as usual, arose to the occasion.
She assisted to unpack. She expressed the
proper amount of enthusiasm and admiration
at each edible as it was brought forth.
When the contents had been properly disposed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
of on every available window-sill,
study-table and on the floor close to the wall
where they would not be in the way of passing
feet, she arose from her knees before
the empty box. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have the spread
to-night, I suppose. Some of the girls will
be away to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth had been long enough at Exeter
to learn the meaning of that magic word
&#8220;spread.&#8221; There are receptions, socials
and spreads, but the greatest of these are
spreads. A spread means slipping through
dimly lighted corridors long after the retiring-bell
has sounded its last warning; it
means bated breaths, whispers and suppressed
giggles. Its regalia is dressing-gowns
or kimonos with bedroom slippers.
It means mysterious knocks at the hostess&#8217;
door; a hurried skirmish within; and when
it is found that one of the enlightened is
rapping for admission, there is a general
exodus from closets, from behind window
draperies and from beneath study-tables.</p>
<p>Spreads have never been prohibited. Indeed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
it is generally understood that the
faculty would gladly grant permission for
them, if the time and place were opportune.
But never in the history of school-life has
permission been asked. With permission
granted, a spread would not be a spread.
It would be a mere lunch&mdash;an opportunity
to partake of delicacies.</p>
<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s eyes grew big at Mary&#8217;s suggestion.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have it to-night,&#8221; she exclaimed,
&#8220;after the lights are out. Do you
think we could have it here? Mrs. Smiles
is at the end of the hall. We&#8217;ll have to be
so careful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So much the more fun. A spread is
supposed to be risky, else it would not be a
spread. Whom will you invite?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth began to name them on her fingers.
&#8220;Anna Cresswell, Landis, Min,
Mame Welch, and Miss O&#8217;Day.&#8221; Her acquaintance
with the last-named student had
not progressed far enough to permit calling
her by her first name. As far as Miss
O&#8217;Day was concerned, the Exeter girls knew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
not friendship. Elizabeth could see that
the girl herself made no advances. From
her attitude, it was impossible to judge
whether she was proud or shy. Scarcely
the latter, for she carried herself with a
self-poise which was suggestive of confidence.
Elizabeth had not learned the cause
of the estrangement between her and the
other students. No one had ventured an
explanation to her and she would not ask.
Now at the mention of her name, Miss Wilson
grew dignified&mdash;a sure sign that she
was half angry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t ask her,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, simply because I wouldn&#8217;t. None
of the girls ever invite her, or haven&#8217;t for
the last year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, no doubt I do a great many
things which none of the other girls do, so
I might as well do this. I don&#8217;t object to
being a little odd.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you do&mdash;if you take Nora
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
O&#8217;Day up and make a friend of her, the
other girls will surely cut you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut me?&#8221; exclaimed Elizabeth, for the
first time in her life fairly indignant. Her
pride was aroused. &#8220;Cut me? Well, let
that be as they choose. They&#8217;ll not have
the opportunity, for I can let them as
severely alone as they do Nora O&#8217;Day. If
I cannot invite whom I please to my spread
without asking the advice of a dozen other
girls, then I&#8217;ll not have it at all. I don&#8217;t
know and don&#8217;t wish to know why you girls
snub Miss O&#8217;Day. As far as I can see,
she acts quite as well as some others at
Exeter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t snub her, at least I have never
done so. I treat her with conventional
courtesy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Conventional courtesy! Deliver me
from it, then. Why, the thermometer falls
below zero whenever she comes where you
girls are together. I know no evil of her.
She has always treated me nicely, and I
shall treat her so. When I discover that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
she is not fit to associate with, then I&#8217;ll let
her alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Elizabeth, if you only knew!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t know and I don&#8217;t want to
know.&#8221; Mary hesitated. She was not
tempted to tell Elizabeth the whole story of
the year before. She was never tempted to
tell news or bruit from one student to another
what was no concern of hers. She
hesitated because she was uncertain whether
it paid to carry the discussion further.
After a moment&#8217;s thought, she decided that
much talking would not be effective.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, Elizabeth, do as you please.
Ask anyone you choose. Of course the
spread is yours. But if you ask Nora
O&#8217;Day, you may expect to find me occupied
at that time. Landis will not mind if I go
over to her rooms. I&#8217;m off now to geometry!
Of course, I&#8217;ll help you get ready
and all that.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this parting shot, she quitted the
room. Elizabeth had a vacant period following,
a time generally devoted to looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
over her work. To-day she employed it in
reviewing her conversation with Mary Wilson.
She was gradually awakening to the
knowledge that a certain independence of
thought and action was necessary if one
would not become a mere tool used by each
and all of her friends. At Bitumen, her
parents and Miss Hale had influenced her.
But there had been such a sweet unselfishness
in all they did, such an evidence that
they were working for her good, that Elizabeth
had allowed their will to become her
own. As she considered the matter now,
she could remember no instance when she
had been conscious of feeling that any other
course of action save that which they suggested
would have been pleasing to her.
She was fond of her roommate. Mary had
helped her over many a little difficulty in
regard to classes and gym work. She was
one of those whole-souled girls who was
more than ready and willing to divide both
her good times and her possessions.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had not become so interested in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
Miss O&#8217;Day that her presence at the spread
would cause her any great pleasure. Had
Mary Wilson not shown such a spirit of
authority, such a desire to have her own will
in this, Elizabeth would have dropped the
matter without a thought. But now she
felt that she would ask Miss O&#8217;Day. If she
did so, she <i>would</i> be an independent person;
if she did not, she would be doing merely
as her roommate wished, in a blind way,
without knowing the reason for her action.</p>
<p>While she was pondering the matter,
there came back to her the words her father
had spoken when he had planned to send her
to school. &#8220;The girls will teach you more
than any of the faculty.&#8221; There was one
thing they would teach her, she decided
instantly, and that was to form her own
opinions of people, and to follow out her
own course of action. She would ask Miss
O&#8217;Day to her spread. Mary Wilson could
come or stay away just as she chose. Mary
should decide that matter for herself.</p>
<p>When once Elizabeth made a decision,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
there was no dilly-dallying, no going back
and wondering if she had done the right
thing. Taking up her pencil, she began to
jot down the names of those to be invited.
Nora O&#8217;Day&#8217;s name headed the list with
Azzie Hogan&#8217;s tagged on at the last. The
majority of the girls were at class. Her
only opportunity for seeing them was immediately
before dinner or during study-hour
in the evening, providing Mrs. Smiles
did not keep too close a watch.</p>
<p>She wondered what Mary Wilson would
think of asking Azzie Hogan. Azzie did
not take advantage of the social privileges
of Exeter. Azzie was a genius&mdash;a boarding
student who put in all her time with music&mdash;who
sat for hours producing the most
marvelous tones from instruments where
other girls drew discords&mdash;who would sit all
day at the piano, and not find the time long;
and who spent her leisure in dawdling over
sofas, or playing practical jokes on every
one about her. She was a long-limbed, fair-haired
girl, with a touch of wit from some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
remote ancestor who must have had O&#8217;
tacked to his name, and a great inaptitude
toward books. She could play. Exeter
had never before boasted such skill as hers.
Her fame had spread over the state. But
other lessons were impossible.</p>
<p>The subject of the guests was not brought
up again between the roommates. Mary
had a successful interview with the matron,
and returned to her rooms with cream for
cocoa, and a few forks and spoons, borrowing
cups and plates from the girls in the
hall. Elizabeth had a class late in the afternoon.
When she came back she found the
work she planned already done. She
started off immediately to issue her invitations.</p>
<p>The rooms occupied by Min and Landis
were nearest her own. She stopped there
first. She found the girls busy, Landis at
the study-table, putting the last touches to
a composition for the following day&#8217;s rhetoric.
Min was sitting on a low chair by
the window, sewing braid on the bottom of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
a dress-skirt. Unconsciously, Elizabeth
gave the article in Min&#8217;s hand a second
glance, and recognized it as the skirt Landis
generally wore to class.</p>
<p>Landis, whose eye was quick to note all
that occurred in her presence, caught the
second glance. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t Min good?&#8221; she
asked. &#8220;She is putting a new braid on my
everyday skirt. I caught my heel in it yesterday
and ripped the binding almost off.
If there is one piece of work which I detest
above another, it is putting on braids.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about Min?&#8221; asked Elizabeth.
&#8220;Does she enjoy it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t <i>dislike</i> it,&#8221; was the response.
&#8220;She likes to be busy, and is quite
as content to be at that as at some of the
greater things of life. Min does that for
me, and I&#8217;m left free to do a line of work
which would not claim her.&#8221; As she spoke,
she arose and moved from the table. Before
doing so, she was careful to lay a book
across the top of the page on which she had
been writing. She might have placed it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
there to keep the papers from being scattered
over the room, but it looked more as
though she placed it in a position to hide the
title. She sank down in a low chair beside
Elizabeth and watched Min work. Her
speech impressed her hearer that she was
doing work of so high an order that common
spirits like her own could not comprehend.
Elizabeth had heard Landis make
such reference before, but after having
talked with Miss Rice, she concluded that
Landis, when speaking in her own peculiar
way, had in mind the life of a missionary
which was to be hers on leaving school.
Elizabeth had a great reverence for religion.
So while Landis made these
speeches, she listened with becoming attention.</p>
<p>But Min, to whom all things were material,
and the nearest point the only one
seen, blurted out in her slow, uncomprehending
way, &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;d much rather sew on
a binding than to do the work Landis does.
What one of us likes to do, the other one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
don&#8217;t. So we fit fairly well as roommates.
This noon when she was complaining about
the mending she must do, I told her I&#8217;d do
it all if she&#8217;d get my thesis ready for to-morrow.
We have a discussion on the Literature
of the Elizabethan Period. As
though I could write a thousand words on
that! So we traded off.&#8221;</p>
<p>A flush had come to Landis&#8217; cheek while
her roommate talked. She stopped her as
quickly as was consistent with tact. When
once Min started it was impossible to tell
when she would stop.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Elizabeth about the trip your father
is planning,&#8221; said Landis, breaking into
Min&#8217;s discourse.</p>
<p>But Elizabeth arose, declaring that she
had no time to stay longer; she had merely
stopped in to ask them both to come to her
room for a spread that evening, any time
after the lights were out.</p>
<p>&#8220;A box from home!&#8221; exclaimed Min.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that lovely? That is what it means
to have a mother! Our housekeeper is as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
kind as can be and would be only too glad
to send me a box if she thought of it. But
that is the difference, a mother would think.
If father was there, I&#8217;d go home to-morrow.
But he won&#8217;t be, so I would rather
stay here than be in that big house
alone with servants. Landis has an invitation
to go out into the country for dinner.
I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;d go if I were she. Miss
Rice has asked her to come but she won&#8217;t
go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not think it would be kind to leave
Min alone,&#8221; she said, as though that were
her sole motive in staying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Rice!&#8221; exclaimed Elizabeth. &#8220;I
know her. I met her the evening of the
reception.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite a character, isn&#8217;t she?&#8221; responded
Landis, as she might have spoken of one
with whom she had but a passing acquaintance,
instead of one on whom she was depending
for all she had. &#8220;I often think she
would make an admirable character for a
novel. If my talent ran in that direction,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
I would certainly put Betty Rice in a
book.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she related to you?&#8221; asked Elizabeth
in that innocent way which springs
from the heart of one who has no guile and
does not suspect others.</p>
<p>Landis drew down her eyebrows and pondered
as though she were figuring out just
what the relation was. The impression her
manner gave to one who was merely a casual
observer was that she deliberated and
thought before speaking in order that her
statements might not deviate by a hairbreadth
from justice and truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just trying to think if she really
were related at all or if we call her so from
mere courtesy. If she be related to us, it
is so distant that I cannot explain it. I
fancy we call her so without any blood ties
at all. You know how it is with a family
like ours&mdash;in fact all English families of the
upper class. We&#8217;ve lived in one place for
generations, and always have played the
Lady Bountiful to the poorer folk until they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
grow to believe they have a claim upon us.
Betty Rice is not the only one of these
hangers-on. But I&#8217;m not complaining.
She&#8217;s a good soul and always does her best.
I really have a fondness for her. You can
be sure that so long as I have a home Betty
shall have one too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Min Kean had never talked with Miss
Rice or Miss Rice&#8217;s friends. She forthwith
expressed her admiration of Landis&#8217; noble
generosity of spirit and purse.</p>
<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s lack of experience in meeting
with people made her slow to comprehend
and compare. Although she remembered
Miss Rice&#8217;s statements made the evening of
the reception, and now heard those made by
Landis, she did not reach a conclusion in
regard to them. It was not until weeks
later that her mind sifted these conflicting
ideas, placing and ticketing each in its
proper relation.</p>
<p>&#8220;But about the spread! You&#8217;ll
come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s useless to ask such a question! Of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
course we&#8217;ll come. We have never been
known to miss a spread.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other girls accepted with the same
readiness. It was not until Azzie was
reached that any uncertainty arose.</p>
<p>Azzie was at the piano when Elizabeth
found her. &#8220;It depends,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;If
Smiles will allow me to do overtime this
evening, I won&#8217;t be able to come. I&#8217;ll be
too tired. If she&#8217;s cranky and locks up the
music room, I&#8217;ll come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I hope she&#8217;ll be cranky. We want
you,&#8221; was the response.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t. Professor Van Buren gave me
the sweetest thing to-day&mdash;a little German
composition. I want to work on it. It
isn&#8217;t hard, but the runs need practice.&#8221;
She turned back to her music.</p>
<p>Elizabeth went on to find Miss O&#8217;Day.
Their acquaintance had not gone beyond
that of class-room meetings and hall chats.
She had never visited the girl&#8217;s rooms.
She was surprised at their beauty and elegance.
All the Exeter girls had comfortable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
apartments, but this surpassed anything
else at the Hall. The draperies between
the doors were of imported India material;
her tea-table showed many pieces of
Royal Worcester; her extra chairs were of
fine cabinet woods. The occupant of the
room was seated in a low chair by the fire.
She was already dressed for dinner. Since
the evening Dr. Morgan had sent her to her
room because she had appeared in a low-necked
gown, her dressing had been less
elaborate, yet by no means could it be called
simple.</p>
<p>Her hands were covered with rings. Her
hair was piled high in quite the fashion of a
grown-up woman. It was more noticeable,
perhaps, because the younger students at
Exeter wore their hair in girlish fashion.</p>
<p>She arose to greet Elizabeth, shaking her
by the hand and leading her to a chair.
She was pleased that Elizabeth had called,
yet her manner had a certain icy courtesy
about it which made her guest ill at ease.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first time you have come to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
see me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But I am glad you
have come at last. Sit here. This low
chair is the most comfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t time,&#8221; said Elizabeth. Nevertheless
she took the proffered chair.
&#8220;Your rooms are beautiful, Miss O&#8217;Day,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;As you say, this is the first time
I have been in them, but I had caught
glimpses from the hall of your pretty
draperies and chairs. Your tea-table is a
dream.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why haven&#8217;t you come in before and
seen it close at hand?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>Elizabeth knew no polite way of evading
the question. She was not skilled in the
little methods of saying much and meaning
little.</p>
<p>&#8220;You never came to see me,&#8221; she replied,
&#8220;and I fancied you did not care to have me
come, though you have always been very
pleasant when I have met you in the hall.
But I supposed if you wanted to know
me better, you would have come to see
me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></p>
<p>A peculiar expression passed over the
hearer&#8217;s face. She gave Elizabeth a quick,
questioning glance, as though she doubted
the good faith of this statement. But the
glance satisfied her that her visitor was not
acting a part. She leaned forward as
though to warm her hands at the grate. In
reality, she was taking time to consider well
her words before she spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really wished to call on you,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;but hesitated lest I intrude. Your
roommate, Miss Wilson, would not be at all
pleased to have me. That is why I did not
call.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the rooms are half mine! She
would have nothing at all to do with my
callers. Surely that was a queer sort of
reason to keep away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the first reason. Then there
was another. How should I know that you
would receive me? One girl influences another
so. I knew Miss Wilson did not wish
me to come. How was I to know that she
had not filled your mind so with school gossip
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
that you, too, would be glad to have me
keep at a distance?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s manner of speaking was peculiar.
It was difficult to understand whether
she were hiding her arrogant pride by an assumption
of humility or whether she truly
felt that her calls would not be looked upon
with favor. Her manner was not easy at
any time. It was marked by a self-consciousness
that gave her companions the impression
that the little courtesies from well-bred
people were something new to her.</p>
<p>Elizabeth flared up at her words. &#8220;Do
you think I&#8217;m a handful of putty,&#8221; she
asked, &#8220;to be moulded any way my companions
choose? I form my own opinions. So
long as you treat me fairly, I would do the
same by you. But really, you do Mary an
injustice. She never told me anything
against you. Of course, I knew there was
some feeling that was not altogether
friendly between you. But I learned that
from <i>your</i> manner as much as I did from
hers.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>Miss O&#8217;Day made no response. Elizabeth
waited a few moments for her to answer.
Being disappointed in this, she
turned the conversation to the object of her
errand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother sent me a box. The girls will
be in for a spread this evening and I want
you to come. It will be at the usual hour&mdash;any
time after lights are out and you can
get rid of Smiles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth arose, moving toward the door.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll have less than ten minutes to dress for
dinner. Do you think I can do it in that
time? I haven&#8217;t been late since I came to
Exeter, so I shall not hurry now. One late
mark will keep me in harmony with the rest
of the girls.&#8221; Her hand was upon the
knob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, Miss Hobart!&#8221; Miss O&#8217;Day had
arisen. There was a sound of rustling petticoats
as she moved. She twisted her
hands nervously as though dreading to
speak. &#8220;I should like nothing better than
coming. I haven&#8217;t been to a &#8216;blow-out&#8217; this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
fall. But I hardly think I can come now.&#8221;
She hesitated. She spoke slowly as though
she could not put her thoughts into the
proper words. &#8220;I really wish to come, Miss
Hobart. It is kind of you to ask me. I
don&#8217;t want to take advantage of your goodness,
so I must tell you why the girls here
do not care to know me. I did something
wrong last year&mdash;something they look upon
as dreadful. They all belong to the Christian
Association. As an Association they
are pledged to discountenance just what I
did. I&#8217;m not a member. So since last spring
I&#8217;ve been cut out of every social affair except
those the school gives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I call that mean,&#8221; cried Elizabeth.
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they were right in one way. I tell
you so much because I cannot accept your
invitation if you do not know. If you wish
me to tell you all about it, I will, although
I have spoken of the matter to no one. I
couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t want to hear. I wish you to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
come to-night. I&#8217;d rather find matters out
for myself. You&#8217;ll come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does Miss Wilson know you intend asking
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course. I made out the list this
morning.&#8221; She did not add that Miss Wilson
had expressed herself rather strongly
on the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then I shall come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go, or I shall be too late to get
any dinner at all. This is roast beef night,
too; and that&#8217;s the night I always pay the
cook a compliment by eating two portions&mdash;my
own and Anna Cresswell&#8217;s. She
doesn&#8217;t like roast beef, and I don&#8217;t like rice
pudding. So we trade. Good-bye. I&#8217;ll
see you then to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The mail has come,&#8221; was Miss Wilson&#8217;s
greeting, as Elizabeth entered her room.
&#8220;I have a letter from Mrs. Gleason. She
writes to invite me to spend a Sabbath with
her at my earliest convenience. I am to
bring you along. I did not know you knew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
her. I&#8217;ve mentioned her so often and you
never said that you were friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know her.&#8221; Elizabeth was
struggling into a white shirtwaist as she
talked. &#8220;I never saw her. There must be
some mistake about her asking me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; there&#8217;s the letter. Read it when
you have leisure. I thought from the way
she wrote that she knew you well. Odd,
isn&#8217;t it? But we&#8217;ll go. It is the best place
to visit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we cannot go for several weeks.
I&#8217;m to lead Sabbath evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I can&#8217;t go until Anna Cresswell can
be here. She has been going away on Saturday.
They need a soprano. And she
and I appear to be the only availables.&#8221;
Mary shook back her hair, as she adjusted
the last pin in her cuff. &#8220;There&#8217;s the last
bell, Elizabeth, and you&#8217;re not half ready.
Well, I&#8217;ll hurry on, and if you are locked
out, I&#8217;ll get Maggie to bring your dinner up
here. She&#8217;ll do anything if you give her a
small tip.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3>HOW &#8220;SMILES&#8221; WAS SCALPED.</h3>
</div>

<p>Azzie Hogan was the last to appear at the
spread. The first course had been diverted
to its proper use, and the ice which marked
the manner of both Mary Wilson and
Landis Stoner because of the presence of
Miss O&#8217;Day had thawed enough to permit a
feeling of ease among the girls, when Azzie
arrived.</p>
<p>There was a motley array of every color
of kimono that the mind of girl could conceive.
Their wearers were being comfortable
on chairs and stools so far as they held
out. The girls in excess of the number had
curled themselves up, Turkish fashion, on
cushions on the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Smiles must have allowed Azzie to practice,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
said Mary Wilson, with a leg of
chicken held aloft.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary looks like Liberty enlightening the
world,&#8221; said Elizabeth. &#8220;The drumstick
answers very well for a torch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Liberty <i>frightening</i> the world,&#8221; said
Mame Welch. &#8220;Whatever made her do it&mdash;get
a red kimono with her hair that
shade?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearest thing I could get to match,&#8221;
said Mary, laughing. &#8220;I got it at a bargain.
I didn&#8217;t need it. I have more lounging
robes than I can possibly wear; but this
piece was reduced from twenty-five cents to
fifteen. I saved one-twenty by buying it.
We&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>As she was speaking her voice ascended
the scale until it might have been audible
half-way down the hall. She was called to
a halt by a most decided rap upon the door.
An awesome silence fell upon the room.
Instantly every girl except the rightful
owners of the room disappeared. No word
had been spoken. Only the moving of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
couch draperies, the gentle swaying of the
portieres, or the closing of the wardrobe
door gave hint as to the places of disappearance.
Again came the knock. Mary Wilson
with suspicious haste opened the door.
&#8220;He-he,&#8221; giggled Azzie, entering. &#8220;You
thought it was Mrs. Smiles. Come, girls.
Come out. Mrs. Schuyler will not appear
this night, or to-morrow either, if I am not
mistaken.&#8221;</p>
<p>At her invitation the girls came forth.
Azzie was too tall, too long to seat herself
with any grace of body. She had the effect
of sprawling. That she did now. Her
purple kimono, resplendent with green roses
and bands, caused her to look like a great
rag-doll with most of the sawdust missing.
The others of the party arranged themselves
on cushions and chairs about her,
ready to fall, tooth and nail, upon the remains
of the roast chicken. Azzie would
not eat, but kept her hand hidden in the
folds of her gown.</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t be talking in stage whispers,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
she began, with a fine touch of Irish
in her voice. &#8220;Smiles won&#8217;t hear you&mdash;or
at least she won&#8217;t be coming here. Yell, if
you choose, or dance a clog. You&#8217;re as safe
as though Smiles was in Halifax.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too sure. I never like to run a
risk,&#8221; said Landis. &#8220;I should not like to be
called into the office to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have found it this way with Mrs.
Schuyler,&#8221; explained Mary Wilson. &#8220;The
moment you are sure she isn&#8217;t about, that is
the moment you can be sure she is ready to
pounce on you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she won&#8217;t be here now. I&#8217;ll yell
and see.&#8221; She yelled&mdash;a yell that must
have have reached to the end of the dormitory
and pierced any number of closed
doors. The girls suppressed their half-frightened
giggles, and waited. Azzie was
right. Mrs. Schuyler did not appear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t she come?&#8221; asked Min
Kean in a whisper. &#8220;She surely heard
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;ve taken her scalp,&#8221; said Azzie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
So speaking, she drew forth her hand,
dangling two sets of false fronts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you didn&#8217;t dare!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How could you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be sent home, Azzie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you ever get them?&#8221; asked
Elizabeth. To her, such an act was more
than merely hazardous. It was recklessness
itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I got them,&#8221; said Azzie coolly. &#8220;I
had a bit of neuralgia. A wisdom tooth has
been bothering me for a long time, and I
stopped in after the retiring-bell rang to
ask Mrs. Schuyler for a drop of medicine to
put in it. She was ready for bed. Say,
girls, did you ever see her when she wasn&#8217;t
rigged out? She looked like a fright. She
hasn&#8217;t much hair left, but what she has was
done up in curling kids. And these,&#8221; dangling
the false fronts before their eyes, &#8220;these
lay reposing on the top of the dresser. I
brought them along to show you girls how
fine they are&mdash;two grades, one for every day
and one for dress-up days.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t shake them so close over my cocoa,
please,&#8221; cried Landis, removing her cup beyond
the reach of Azzie&#8217;s scalps.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt safe about coming so long as I had
these,&#8221; continued Azzie. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid,
Landis. A few hairs more or less won&#8217;t
hurt your supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How will you get them back?&#8221; asked
Elizabeth, who was fearful for Azzie&#8217;s welfare.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t got that far in my thinking,&#8221;
was the droll response. &#8220;I knew nothing
could induce her to visit us without these,&#8221;
with another Indian flourish of the scalps in
the air. &#8220;We are safe to-night. To-morrow
Smiles will have a headache, and will
not be able to come down to breakfast, and
perhaps not during the entire day. Drop
in to-morrow to ask her something and see
if you do not find her with her head tied
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was impossible not to laugh at Azzie.
There was such a droll dryness to her humor,
a peculiar touch to her way of saying things
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
which made her most ordinary expressions
masquerade as wit. At times she lacked
tact which caused her companions no little
embarrassment. This trait was made
evident by her turning to Miss O&#8217;Day with
the remark:</p>
<p>&#8220;And, Nora, are you here? I&#8217;m as surprised
to see you as I am to be here myself.&#8221;
Then turning to Elizabeth, she added
as an explanation, &#8220;The &#8216;Exclusives&#8217;
had no time for Miss O&#8217;Day last spring, and
I was always too much wrapped up in my
music to be good company. So we were not
invited to the spreads in the hall. I&#8217;m
glad, Elizabeth, you broke over and invited
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss O&#8217;Day&#8217;s face grew crimson. Elizabeth,
too embarrassed to respond, remained
silent. Miss Wilson arose to the occasion,
changing the subject with the question,
&#8220;When is Miss Kronenberg going back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not until Monday,&#8221; replied Landis, who
was rarely embarrassed. These two, with
the assistance of Mame Welch and Carrie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
Hirsch, diverted the attention from Miss
O&#8217;Day.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not German lessons take. Fraulein
is not my instructor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she is mine,&#8221; responded Mary
Wilson with a sigh. &#8220;As in a dream I hear
her say, &#8216;Fraulein Wilson, you have it unright.&#8217;
I&#8217;ve taken lessons from her for
three years, and that is the only remark she
has ever made to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She will be giving examinations soon,&#8221;
said Mame. &#8220;The Seniors and Middlers
finish her work fully a week before the midwinter
holiday. It gives us time to cram on
something else. It won&#8217;t be long now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Last year, indeed for several years, she
has asked the class to write in German a
description of a walk in the woods, or our
Christmas at home, or what our college life
has done for us. It is always the same.
She lets you choose one of the three, but
you must write a certain amount before she
will accept it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Landis and I are ready for it,&#8221; began
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
Min Kean placidly. &#8220;We have ours written
ready for her. I took a &#8216;Walk in the
Woods,&#8217; for my subject. I did want to take
&#8216;What Exeter has Done for Me,&#8217; but Landis
persuaded me out of it. Of course, she was
right about it. No one expects me to write
on subjects as deep as Landis. We have
ours all finished and ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Min,&#8221; cried her roommate.
&#8220;One would think to hear you talk that we
were expecting to pony through. You
know such an idea is the one furthest from
our minds. You leave such false impressions.&#8221;
Then turning to the girls, she explained,
&#8220;I knew Fraulein Kronenberg
was in the habit of asking for such work in
the examinations, so I told Min there would
be no harm in our practicing at this work.
It would be quite the same thing as though
we were reviewing our lessons. Of course,
we had no intention of handing them in.&#8221;
Landis always appeared several inches taller
when she sought to justify herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;The day we are free of German, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
day will Miss Brosius put us to extra work
in elocution and oratory. If I read the
stars right, I discovered a play in the corner
of her eye when I saw her last. She has
already begun to estimate each one of us,
to see who will best serve her purpose.
Anna Cresswell is already doomed. She is
always dragged in for the beautiful, calm
creature who doeth and thinketh no evil. I
wonder why she is always selected when
I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose they know you&#8217;d overdo it,&#8221;
suggested Azzie, lazily. &#8220;Thank goodness,
there are some things I escape by not being
quick to learn my part. They never tried
me but once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you always play. I&#8217;d rather any
day get up and strut over the stage, shrieking
&#8216;Is that a dagger that I see before me?&#8217;
than sit down and keep my fingers on the
right keys,&#8221; said Mame Welch.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is certainly wonderful how Azzie can
play,&#8221; said Min. &#8220;Every one seems to enjoy
it; but, do you know, just for myself,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
I like popular airs best? Beethoven and
Mozart may be fine, but I like the kind that
the newsboys whistle and all the hurdy-gurdies
play.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t Mozart turn in his grave if
he heard her?&#8221; asked Mame. &#8220;Speak to
her, Azzie. Reason with her. You are the
only one who has artistic sense enough to be
shocked. Tell her to keep quiet, like the
others of us do, and pretend to revel in delight
at Wagner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will the Middlers be in it, too?&#8221; asked
Elizabeth. Her heart failed at the thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mary, seeing that Elizabeth
was really concerned at the prospect of appearing
in public. &#8220;Yes, they give the
Middlers several parts. You see, their idea
is to get the Middlers used to public speaking
so that they will appear well when they
are Seniors. All the experiences or lessons
Middlers ever get are given them in order
to fit them to be Seniors.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lunch had been progressing during
the chatter. A few drumsticks and several
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
slices of cake remained to show what had
been. Elizabeth and Mary, with true
housewifely instinct, put away the remnants
of the feast after their guests had finished.</p>
<p>&#8220;How economical you are becoming!&#8221;
said Mame Welch. &#8220;If I become hungry
to-morrow, I will visit while you are not
here. If you miss anything, I think you
may give Landis the credit of taking it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Landis shrugged her shoulders. &#8220;To see
how careful they are, one would think they
never had much to eat before and don&#8217;t expect
much again. Now, I&#8217;d throw the
whole lot of it into the scrap-basket and let
Jimmy Jordan carry it off with the refuse.
You bring to my mind that woman we met
the day we came back to Exeter. She was
horrified because I didn&#8217;t take what was
left of our lunch and run about offering it
to some people who did not have any with
them. She went outside and shared hers
with such a common-looking woman and
two dirty, crying babies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And me, too,&#8221; said Elizabeth, not a whit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
abashed that she had been one of the party
which Landis saw fit to criticise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; was the reply, &#8220;But I suppose
you were forced into it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t forced into it,&#8221; Elizabeth replied.
&#8220;Indeed, I was glad to go. It was
like a little picnic out there under the
tree&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With two crying babies?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They did not cry after we went out.
And the woman whom you laugh at was
very agreeable. The wait did not seem at
all long. It was rather like a pleasant
party.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, tastes differ,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;I
am glad you enjoyed it. I&#8217;m sure I should
not. Come, Min, don&#8217;t you think we had
better pick our steps back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Walk as you please. The great Hokee
Bokee Chief of the Night Hawks has taken
the scalp of the pale-faced scout,&#8221; shouted
Mary Wilson, jumping to her feet and, seizing
the false fronts, she waved them madly
in the air while she executed a war-dance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Give them back to Azzie,&#8221; said Mame.
&#8220;Sometime early to-morrow morning you
will find that the pale-faced scout is close
on Azzie&#8217;s trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Azzie took the trophies in her hand, examining
them critically. &#8220;To-morrow I
intend to go in and call upon her. I know
she&#8217;ll have a towel bound around her head.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls were about to depart when
Mame Welch exclaimed, &#8220;There, I almost
forgot! Anna Cresswell has been invited
down to Gleasonton to visit at the Senator&#8217;s.
Mrs. Gleason is arranging quite a
party of Exeter girls as soon as they can
have a free Saturday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Elizabeth and I were invited to-day,&#8221;
said Mary. &#8220;We were to let Mrs. Gleason
know what Saturday we would have free.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They have fine times there&mdash;so they tell
me,&#8221; Azzie said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never been invited
to see for myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know Mrs. Gleason personally,&#8221;
remarked Landis, &#8220;but we have the
same set of friends. No doubt if I should
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
tell her that I&#8217;m Robert Stoner&#8217;s daughter,
she&#8217;d out-do herself to be kind to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Elizabeth guilelessly, &#8220;was
she such a friend of your father&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>Landis shrugged her shoulders. &#8220;My
father was a man of some prominence,&#8221;
was the response. &#8220;But how is it that she
invited you? Did you not tell me that you
did not know her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t. I have never so much as seen
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s very philanthropic&mdash;always trying
to help people who need it. I suppose
she knew you were a new student, and perhaps
hadn&#8217;t a wide acquaintance here, so
she invited you that you might not find life
too dull.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; was the reply, with a smile
of amusement. Elizabeth was learning a
great deal, not less important that it lay
outside of classes and books.</p>
<p>The other girls had departed. Only
Landis and Miss O&#8217;Day remained. Then
the former with a whispered &#8220;good-night&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
went tip-toeing down the hall. Miss O&#8217;Day
lingered.</p>
<p>Much to Elizabeth&#8217;s surprise she bent her
head to kiss her. &#8220;It was very kind of you,
Elizabeth, to ask me to come this evening.
But the other girls did not like it. Come
to see me. You and I will grow chummy
over my tea-table. But you do not need to
ask me again when you entertain. I will
not feel hurt. If you persist in being good
to me, they will drop you and you will find
it very lonely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They may do as they see fit,&#8221; she responded
with determination. &#8220;I will entertain
whom I wish. If they do not choose
to come, then they have the alternative.
Good-night! Don&#8217;t worry about me, Miss
O&#8217;Day. I&#8217;m learning to take care of myself.&#8221;
Then she put up her lips to be
kissed again.</p>
<p>The following morning the preceptress
did not appear at breakfast, as Azzie had
predicted. The dinner hour, according to
the custom for all holidays, had been postponed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
until two o&#8217;clock. Devotional exercises
were held in the chapel at ten o&#8217;clock.
Mrs. Schuyler&#8217;s place on the rostrum was
vacant.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s been in her room all morning,&#8221;
giggled Min to Landis on their way to their
rooms.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope Azzie will see the error of her
ways before dinner time,&#8221; Mary Wilson
said. &#8220;I should not like to miss a Thanksgiving
dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>As though Mary&#8217;s words had power to
call her, Azzie at that moment came down
the corridor, swinging herself lazily along.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the sixth time I&#8217;ve started for
Mrs. Schuyler&#8217;s room,&#8221; she began at the
sight of the girls. &#8220;But the moment I
reach the door, my heart drops down into
my shoes, and it&#8217;s so heavy, I can&#8217;t move my
feet an inch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Taking scalps is not all the fun it&#8217;s supposed
to be, is it?&#8221; asked Mame Welch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The taking is all right. The taking
<i>back</i> is what hurts my feelings.&#8221; Azzie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
sighed deeply as she began to unwrap the
paper about the false fronts. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know whether I&#8217;ll have the courage to lay
them inside her door or not. I&#8217;d put it off
until to-morrow if it wasn&#8217;t for the Thanksgiving
dinner. Well, there&#8217;s luck in odd
numbers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To me there would be something too
subtle, too sly, in slipping them in at the
door.&#8221; The remark was from Landis.</p>
<p>As usual, Mary Wilson was the one quick
to reply. &#8220;Then Azzie will not do it if
there be but a suspicion of subtleness about
it. Do you not know her well enough, Landis,
to know when she is jesting and when
she is not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, let us hope she was jesting
then,&#8221; was the reply.</p>
<p>The seventh venture had carried a charm
for Azzie. Her heart did not go thumping
to her heels again. She knocked at Mrs.
Schuyler&#8217;s door and then entered without
waiting for permission.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Mrs. Schuyler,&#8221; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
cried gayly. &#8220;I was sorry not to see you
down to breakfast, though to be honest I
did not expect you. Did you miss anything
last evening after I was in? It was too
good a chance&mdash;there they were lying right
under my eyes. I&#8217;ll leave them here,&#8221; laying
the budget on a table near her, &#8220;so you
can come down to dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her manner was not that of one who
merited or expected a rebuke. There was
such a big-hearted friendliness in her voice
that Mrs. Schuyler&#8217;s heart responded. She
smiled in spite of the feeling of vengeance
she had been cherishing against her tormentor.
Before she could regain her austerity
of manner, Azzie had departed and
was half way down the dormitory hall, on
her way to the music-room for an hour&#8217;s
practice before dinner.</p>
<p>Thanksgiving was not a day of unalloyed
happiness to Elizabeth. The afternoon&#8217;s
mail brought her letters and papers from
Bitumen. Her father wrote the home news
with the same gaiety which marked his conversation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
He mentioned, as though it
were a subject to be lightly treated, that
there was some talk of the miners &#8220;going
out.&#8221; He thought their grievance might
be adjusted without resorting to extreme
measures&mdash;a week or so would tell. Then
he took up the little matters of the house.</p>
<p>The letter was remarkably cheerful.
Yet Elizabeth was disturbed in spirit. She
had never lived through a strike; but she
had heard the miners&#8217; wives tell of the
dreadful happenings. So far she thought
only of the suffering of the miners&#8217; families,
with no money, starving and freezing
in their little shanties. She had never
heard how the lives of the operators and
men in the position of her father hung in
the balance at such times.</p>
<p>After reading the letter again, she mechanically
took up the newspaper. The
black headlines heralding the coming strike
were before her. She read column after
column hurriedly. The newspaper attached
greater importance to the rumors
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
than her father. They recounted the horrors
of strikes past, and presaged them for
strikes to come. No definite reasons had
been given for the miners going out. The
article hinted that only the grossest imposition
of the operators had led them to consider
a strike. The names of two men appeared
frequently&mdash;Dennis O&#8217;Day and Ratowsky&mdash;who
were opposed to each other.
Strange to say, neither was a miner. Ratowsky
could influence the men because he
was foreign-born, a Pole, as the majority
of them were. On the other hand, Dennis
O&#8217;Day was a native American, a class of
which the foreign element is suspicious.
Yet at his instigation the miners had
arisen.</p>
<p>The article caused Elizabeth some uneasiness.
She looked forward to the following
day&#8217;s paper, hoping it might contain a
brighter outlook. But on the next day
when she went to the reading room, she
failed to find the papers. For many successive
days the same thing occurred.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
Then at length, she gave up looking for
them. It was not until a month later that
she learned that they had disappeared at
Dr. Morgan&#8217;s suggestion, and the girls were
aiding her in keeping the worrisome news
from Elizabeth.</p>
<p>The letters from home came at their usual
times, but neither her father nor mother
mentioned the trouble at the mines. Elizabeth,
believing that no news was good
news, took it for granted that the difficulty
had been amicably settled.</p>
<p>A week later, in company with Mary
Wilson, she set forth to visit Mrs. Gleason.
From Exeter to Gleasonton is only an
hour&#8217;s ride. At the station, they found a
sleigh with a coachman and footman waiting
to convey them to Senator Gleason&#8217;s
home.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the prettiest place in summer,&#8221;
said Mary, as they went flying over the
snow-packed roads. &#8220;Everything is so
beautiful that you can really believe it is
fairyland.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>On their way, they passed several stately
country residences, closed for the winter.
Then came acres and acres of bark-sheds
filled with bark for the tanneries; then the
tanneries themselves. Then, at a distance,
upon the brow of the hill were seen the
stone walls of Senator Gleason&#8217;s home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it beautiful?&#8221; whispered Elizabeth,
as though should she speak aloud the
spell would be broken, and the place, like
Aladdin&#8217;s palace, vanish in the air.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait until you see it in summer, with
all the vines and beautiful trees,&#8221; was the
response.</p>
<p>They turned into the driveway, and in a
few minutes were brought to the front entrance.
At the sound of the bells, the door
opened and Senator Gleason appeared,
smiling and affable, to welcome them, and
following him was his wife.</p>
<p>Elizabeth gave a start of surprise. Although
more richly dressed than when she
had seen her before, Elizabeth recognized
in her the plain little woman with whom she
had eaten lunch on her journey to Exeter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>DEFYING THE POWERS.</h3>
</div>

<p>Both Fraulein Kronenberg and Dr.
Kitchell announced tests for the week before
the Christmas holidays. The Seniors
and Middlers arose early and stayed
up late to study. The hour for physical
exercise was cut as short as Miss Brosins
would permit. There was little time for
anything that was purely social. There
was no lingering in the hall after meals for
chats. Carrie Hirsch was the only one who
had leisure after Miss Kronenberg&#8217;s announcement.
She laughed as the girls hurried
back to their rooms. &#8220;German is not
so hard,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;What one
thinks one must say&mdash;so simple are the
words. Not at all can I understand why
they all look so like a frown because Fraulein
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
Kronenberg gives them but one little
story to write in the German.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose Miss Berard should give you
a simple little story to write in English,&#8221;
returned Mary Wilson. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you
look like a frown, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Hirsch shrugged her shoulders.
&#8220;It is true you speak; but English is so different.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth felt the excitement attendant
upon an examination. Had she paused
long enough to analyse her feelings, she
would have discovered that she had no fear
of failing. She had read German with
Miss Hale since she was old enough to read.
The Middlers&#8217; work in German had been to
her like an old tale, oft repeated. But the
attitude of the other students and the novelty
of an examination made her nervous.
She was hurrying back to her room one
morning when Anna Cresswell stopped her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have the next period vacant?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but Wednesday is the German exams
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
and I have been putting in this hour
cramming for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll do you a good turn by taking
you away from them. Come, let us take a
turn up and down the campus. We&#8217;ll walk
fast enough to keep warm. There is
something about which I wish to talk to
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Half-reluctantly, Elizabeth went with
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel as though I had been neglecting
my work in regard to you,&#8221; began Miss
Cresswell, as they crossed the campus.
She tucked Elizabeth&#8217;s arm under her own.
Elizabeth felt that something confidential
was forthcoming. She was yet unused to
the friendship of girls and any act on their
part out of the ordinary made her feel shy
and awkward.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you were with Mary Wilson, so I
knew you were in good hands, although I
should have come to you at once. But we
had so many new girls this semester that I
could not get around sooner. I&#8217;m president
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
of the Young Woman&#8217;s Christian Association
at Exeter, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; or at least, I suppose so. I have
always attended with Mary. You preside,
so I took it for granted that you are president.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the public meetings you attended.
We have some private conferences
where no one is present but active members.
We do this that we may talk over the needs
of some special student, and act accordingly.
Of course, we can not publicly diagnose
such cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; said Elizabeth, feeling that Miss
Cresswell had paused to give her an opportunity
to reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of our work is to interview each
new student; to ask them to join us in active
Christian work. We need you in the
Association and I believe you will find,
after you join us, that you have been needing
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps so. There can be no doubt of
the latter, but as to helping you, I am afraid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
I couldn&#8217;t do that. Not that I am not willing,
but I do not believe I am capable of
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll risk that,&#8221; with a smile. &#8220;I&#8217;m
confident that you can do much. The mere
coming out and announcing yourself as a
member of a band of Christian workers will
have a good influence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it will. To be frank with you,
Miss Cresswell, I&#8217;ve never thought about
such a thing. At home I studied a great
deal, helped mother some, and rode about
the country hunting flowers with Miss Hale.
I never gave a thought to the matters that
you talk of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you are not a Christian?&#8221; The
question was asked in surprise.</p>
<p>The girl looked with a puzzled expression
into the serious face of her companion.
Then she spoke slowly, as though the
idea was for the first time presented to
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know. I&mdash;never&mdash;really
thought anything at all about it. You see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
it was just this way at home, Miss Cresswell.
My father and mother with Miss
Hale were all the friends I had. We could
not go to church; the miners are foreigners,
and when a priest was sent to them for
services, he spoke Polish, or Slav, or Russian,
so there was little use of our going.
Miss Hale had a Mission Sabbath School
for the younger people. I asked once to
help her. She refused for some reason.
She did not tell me why. At home, we read
our Bible and have family prayers.
Mother taught me a great deal, and I committed
a great deal to memory; but as to
my being a Christian, I never really
thought of it before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let us think about it now,&#8221; was
the response. She drew Elizabeth&#8217;s arm
closer within her own. Slowly they retraced
their steps from the dormitory door
to the end of the campus walk, Miss Cresswell
talking earnestly all the while. She
spoke well on her subject; she believed
what she said; and she was honest and simple-minded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
in her efforts to present these
truths to Elizabeth&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>The hour passed quickly. With a start
of surprise, they heard the bells for the dismissal
of classes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it possible? I did not think the time
was half gone. We must hurry. You will
think on this matter, Elizabeth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I will think of it. I can&#8217;t promise
more. It seems so serious. I do not wish
to undertake anything without being sure
of what I really think and am.&#8221;</p>
<p>They parted at the door, Miss Cresswell
hurrying off to Dr. Kitchell&#8217;s class-room,
while Elizabeth, with tardy step and disturbed
mind, went to recite to Miss Brosius.</p>
<p>The same evening Elizabeth accompanied
her roommate to a special meeting
of the Young Woman&#8217;s Christian Association.
It had become a custom of the school
to hold such meetings before the tests began,
but Elizabeth, not knowing this, was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
wholly ignorant of the object of the meeting.</p>
<p>Miss Cresswell as president went through
the preliminaries of calling the Association
to order. She was tactful and discreet.
Landis, to whom public speaking was a
coveted opportunity, immediately arose and
moved forward to the front of the room
where she could face her audience. She
carried her head and shoulders unusually
erect. Her clear, decisive manner of
speaking indicated that she believed the
mere stating of her opinion on the subject
would forever settle it in the minds of her
hearers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I regret,&#8221; she began, &#8220;to make such a
statement before the new students at Exeter
lest they form a bad opinion of us in
general. But at Exeter Hall, as in other
schools, all pupils do not have the same
ideals and views of what is right and
wrong. It often happens, and has happened
here within our knowledge, that a
student who would scorn to take any property
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
which was not hers, has taken another&#8217;s
ability, has actually copied work and
handed it in as her own. This has happened
and may happen again. So we,&#8221; the
speaker so placed her emphasis that &#8220;we&#8221;
became the dominant spirit of the school,
&#8220;determined to do as we did last year,&mdash;call
together the members of the Association to
take means to prevent a growth of the
spirit of deception.&#8221;</p>
<p>Landis walked back to her place. Her
manner had been forcible and had impressed
many.</p>
<p>The president asked for expressions of
opinions from the members. The remarks
were not slow in coming. Immediately a
half-dozen girls were upon their feet demanding
recognition.</p>
<p>Mame Welch in her droll, half-humorous
way was the first to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not see why we should trouble ourselves
because from one to a half-dozen
girls among several hundred see fit to copy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
and carry &#8216;ponies&#8217; into class. If they are
satisfied, let them do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, oh,&#8221; cried Carrie Hirsch, not waiting
for permission to speak. &#8220;It is not
fair. It may be so, one girl must hard
work; another girl, work not hard. Yet
one mark, oh, so high,&#8221; she raised her
hands to express how high the grades of the
delinquent might be, &#8220;because into exams
she carry papers, or from her friend&#8217;s
paper she learn all she wishes to write.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other members could not suppress a
smile as Carrie talked. She was so entirely
in earnest, so carried away by her
own enthusiasm, and so badly mixed in her
English.</p>
<p>It was Landis who again responded.
&#8220;That is not the spirit in which we have
undertaken this correction. To the real
student it matters little who may have
higher marks than herself. She studies for
the love of study and the hope of improvement.
Neither should we say that it is
nothing to us whether a half-dozen others
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
are dishonest or not. It is something to us&mdash;or
it should be. We have banded ourselves
together as a set of Christian workers,
and it should be something to us
whether a half-dozen among us are not doing
the honorable thing.&#8221; There was a
war-like tone in Landis&#8217; words. Whatever
weakness there was in the girl&#8217;s character,
she possessed an overwhelming desire to
have people believe that she stood on the
side of right. She was ambitious to be
thought an earnest Christian girl. She
would have left no stone unturned to have
been a leader among the girls. She was
willing to cajole, to cater in order to win
friendship. Yet in spite of all her efforts,
she influenced only a few. Among those
few were none of the stronger girls of Exeter.
Min, to be sure, followed close at her
heels, and one or two others; but they were
not of the brighter lights from either an
ethical or intellectual point of view.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is our duty to go to them&mdash;to talk to
them,&#8221; she continued.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And have a hornet&#8217;s nest buzzing about
your ears,&#8221; exclaimed Mary Wilson, disregarding
all the rules of Parliamentary law
which Dr. Kitchell tried to teach them.
She was on her feet, moving to the front,
talking as she went. &#8220;I really haven&#8217;t the
self-assertion to walk up to strange students
and tell them the error of their ways.
To me, that course of action savors too
much of conceit of our own virtues. The
best we can do is to be perfectly honorable
about the examinations. Our mental attitude
toward dishonorable proceedings
ought to have its influence without our going
about making ourselves odious by
preaching.&#8221;</p>
<p>Someone else took up the discussion. It
grew warmer and warmer. Landis maintained
the position she took in regard to
personal work. In the excitement, several
talked at once, forgetting that there was a
chairman to whom a certain courtesy was
due. Miss Cresswell used the gavel until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
its sound drowned out the voices. For a
time peace reigned again.</p>
<p>During the discussion, Elizabeth leaned
forward. This was intensely interesting
to her. Her lips were parted, and a flush
caused by excitement came to her cheeks.
She looked with admiration upon those
girls who could talk in public. In her eyes
they were gifted creatures more richly
blessed than the ordinary mortal like herself.
Hitherto she had been fond of
spunky little Mary Wilson. Now she admired
and looked up to her as one must
look up to a person of talents.</p>
<p>Miss O&#8217;Day, dressed in a striking gown
of imported material, sat by the side of
Elizabeth. She must have heard the discussion,
yet she made no show of interest,
but seemed like one whose thoughts were
far off.</p>
<p>Suddenly a sprightly little girl sprang
up and made herself heard: &#8220;I think we
had a fairly good plan last year&mdash;the plan
we copy from the old Greeks&mdash;the plan of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
ostracising. Girls have copied and cheated
in examinations ever since examinations
were known, and I suppose they will do so
as long as examinations are held. There
are always a few whose bump of moral responsibility
isn&#8217;t developed. I agree with
one of the previous speakers this far&mdash;let
those half-dozen who desire to cheat, cheat.
Let it be nothing to us. But I would add
this much more&mdash;let <i>them</i> be also nothing
to us. Let us ostracise them entirely, cut
them off from all invitations.&#8221;</p>
<p>At her words, the discussion grew
warmer again. It was as though she had
let loose a swarm of bees. Parliamentary
law went to the winds. For a moment,
every common courtesy seemed to be forgotten.
Her suggestion met with some
favor. To the surprise of Elizabeth, Mary
Wilson was its strongest advocate. Landis
now also favored such a course, and consequently
Min Kean. In her heart, Elizabeth
disapproved, but she was not able to
speak as the others had done. She could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
only sit silent. Popular opinion was in
favor of the ostracism. Then another
question was brought up. Landis, again,
was the one to set the ball rolling.</p>
<p>&#8220;But how are we to find out who does the
cheating?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;If I should see
some member of my class make use of a
&#8220;pony,&#8221; am I expected to cut her dead,
while all the others are friendly with her
as usual? I do not see how she would be
much affected by that, for she may care
very little whether I ignore her or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this Landis sat down but she bent forward
and spoke to Min Kean. After a little
encouragement, Min arose. She was
not quick to grasp ideas even at her best.
Now, as she stood upon her feet, she lost
what little confidence she possessed, stumbling
over her words, looking helplessly toward
Landis for encouragement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think&mdash;that is, I think&mdash;that
wouldn&#8217;t count much&mdash;I mean just having
one person ostracise you. I think it should
be told&mdash;I mean if we found anyone cheating,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
it should be told. Then we would get
together and tell that person why we are
going to act toward them like we are going
to act. That&#8217;s only fair. That&#8217;s the way
they treat criminals in court.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she retired to let Landis take her
place. &#8220;The speaker has said in part what
I had in mind. I do not wish my hearers
to believe I would countenance news-carrying
or tattling. That, of course, is beneath
any right-minded person. But we
must&mdash;I say we <i>must</i>,&#8221; Landis raised her
finger impressively, and repeated the words
as though she intended at that moment to
root out the evil with tooth and nail, &#8220;We
<i>must</i> get rid of this deceptive tendency. It
will have an evil effect on Exeter. Perhaps,
in time, destroy the school altogether.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Umph! Exeter has stood a hundred
years and will stand a hundred more in
spite of anything Landis may do,&#8221; said
Miss O&#8217;Day, in a low tone to Elizabeth.
This was the first she had spoken since they
had entered the meeting.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>Landis continued, &#8220;For that reason, I
think it would be wise if one sees another
cheating, to lay her name before the members
and let them act accordingly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth could never tell how it happened.
Months after, in thinking the matter
over, she could not justify herself in
the thought that she had acted from honorable
motives or for any good purpose.
She had acted upon the impulse of the moment.
This last speech was opposed to all
Elizabeth&#8217;s natural instincts. Her finer
feelings were hurt, and like a child she must
cry out.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea is preposterous,&#8221; she exclaimed,
getting upon her feet and walking
to the front of the room. Indignation had
turned to crimson the pink which enthusiasm
had brought to her cheek. &#8220;No
good ever comes of using a wrong to make
another wrong right. Like every one else,
I think there should be no dishonor in examinations.
But to my mind, tale-bearing
is equally dishonorable. Consider the idea
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
of our pledging ourselves to run and tell
every one else when we find that someone
has done wrong. I refuse to do such a
thing even though I know it would stamp
out every bit of cheating in our examinations.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this came a burst of applause, so that
for the time Elizabeth was forced to discontinue.
She saw Mary Wilson&#8217;s eyes beaming
upon her. Not another face could she
distinguish. When the applause ceased,
she began again. It was evident she was
thinking of nothing else but the injustice
and littleness of the act they had been contemplating.
She felt deeply, and talked as
she felt. For a moment she was an orator
worthy the name.</p>
<p>&#8220;For this ostracising, I have as little
sympathy. A student does wrong, and you
would cut her off immediately from all who
are trying to do right. If your purpose is
to assist those weaker than yourself, you
will never succeed by such a method. If
every one was to be ignored for every bit of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
deceit they practice, I fancy most of us
would be going around by ourselves, rather
lonely.&#8221; A smile passed over the faces of
her hearers&mdash;a smile of amusement and surprise,
for hitherto Elizabeth had been a
quiet, shy girl, almost timid in company;
and now upon the instant she had taken the
lead. She had come forth alone when all
the odds were against her, boldly declaring
her opinion, and fearless to defend the
course she believed to be right.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we are going to begin this reformation,
let us begin aright&mdash;at the root of the
evil, and carry it through all its branches.
Let us begin with the students who leave us
under false impressions&mdash;telling us romances
of their adventures, their powerful
friends, their finances.&#8221; To do Elizabeth
justice, the girl with traits like these she
mentioned had no definite form in her mind.
She was only supposing a case. Yet, unconsciously,
her mind had received during
these months of school an idea of such a
person. She could not embody these qualities
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
with a human form. Yet more than one
of her hearers recognized these as characteristics
of one who had been foremost in
the denunciations of dishonest examinations.
&#8220;Let us begin with the girls who
turn out their lights and go to bed long
enough to deceive Mrs. Schuyler, and then
get up again to prowl&mdash;and to the girl who
gets a book from the town library and allows
a dozen to read it before it is returned,
when she has pledged herself to withdraw
the books for her use alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;We, as a set of Christian girls&#8221;&mdash;the
expression was new to Elizabeth, but it does
not take one long to become a Christian&mdash;&#8220;would
ostracise any who did not come up
to our standard of ethics! I say here so
that you may all know where I stand&#8221;&mdash;her
cheeks grew scarlet, and in the energy of her
emotions she emphasized strongly&mdash;&#8220;I will
not declare the name of anyone who &#8216;ponies&#8217;
in class, nor will I cut them from my list
of acquaintances. I shall let them know I
despise such deception, but I shall treat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
them exactly as I have always treated
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that she went back to her place.
To her surprise Miss O&#8217;Day was not there,
having slipped away at the beginning of
Elizabeth&#8217;s talk.</p>
<p>The girls applauded heartily. Someone
else arose to speak. Elizabeth&#8217;s enthusiasm
having died suddenly away, she felt very
limp and weak. She was surprised at her
own boldness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going back to our room,&#8221; she whispered
to Mary Wilson. &#8220;I feel all gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I can sympathize with you. I felt
just so the first time I got up there. But
you&#8217;ll get over it and enjoy a scrap. I&#8217;ll
go with you. A cup of cocoa will set you
up all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Together they quitted the hall. As they
crossed the campus, Mary continued: &#8220;I
was afraid you were going to get personal,
and hurt someone with your words; but you
stopped just in time. One does not mind
if the whole set gets a slap in the face; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
one does not like to be the only one. It is
just this way about the girls you meet at
Exeter. We are like a little town. There
will be a few whom you will like well enough
to be genuine friends with; then there&#8217;s a
whole long line who will be pleasant acquaintances;
and some whom you will care
nothing at all about, although they will be
good people in their way. Some here have
opinions of their own, and some are mere
copies. A girl must learn to think for herself,
and express her opinion without getting
angry or giving personal hits. The
moment that is done, Miss Cresswell
will request the guilty one to leave the
room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will they do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do it? Haven&#8217;t you learned that people
generally do as Anna Cresswell suggests?
She&#8217;s a very poor girl&mdash;too poor to
come to Exeter. But her influence over the
younger set was so marked that they say
Dr. Morgan makes it worth her while to
stay.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What does she do? She seems very
quiet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is&mdash;and isn&#8217;t. She&#8217;s quiet when it&#8217;s
necessary to be. As to what she does, if
you keep your eyes open, you&#8217;ll find her
visiting the homesick girls, introducing the
shy ones, tutoring the backward ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a wonder she did not call upon me
earlier in the term then. I might be classified
under all three heads.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary tossed back her hair, and laughed.
&#8220;But you had me, and when one has me to
look after her she does not need even Anna
Cresswell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Especially when it comes to keeping
rooms in order,&#8221; added Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t forgiven me for that yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I have&mdash;long ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t need disciplining
now. You are growing so particular that
I&#8217;m almost ashamed of my own carelessness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth replied earnestly. &#8220;Well, with
me, I must be decided one way or the other.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
I think I am naturally careless. So I dare
not give up to myself even a little bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>They entered their rooms as she was
speaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just one cup of cocoa, and then we must
get down to work. I&#8217;m afraid of Dr.
Kitchell&#8217;s mathematics.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid of everything. I never took
an examination of any kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Kitchell is very fair; but he scares
you to death weeks before. He is always
holding exams up before you like a death&#8217;s
head at the feast.&#8221;</p>
<p>The decided stand taken by Elizabeth
caused no little discussion. The meeting
adjourned without any definite action being
taken. The only point gained by the discussion
was opening the eyes of a few to the
fact that their point of view might not be
the only one. Many felt as Elizabeth. The
matter was dropped for the time.</p>
<p>The examinations began early in the
morning, running through several class
periods. Elizabeth, provided with a motley
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
array of examination paraphernalia, entered
Dr. Kitchell&#8217;s class-room. The greater
part of the class was already present, as
were Dr. Kitchell and Miss Brosius. Dr.
Kitchell was in the front of the room.
Upon Elizabeth&#8217;s entrance, with a gesture
of his hand, he waved her toward a seat in
the middle row. It was not her accustomed
place of sitting. She looked about her.
There seemed to have been a general scattering.
Each member of the class sat alone,
isolated so far as the size of the room permitted.
The reason for this Elizabeth did
not understand, but attributed it to the eccentricities
of an examination of which she
had heard much. The examination questions,
printed upon little slips, were handed
to each student. Previously each young
lady had been cautioned about providing
herself with all necessary articles. Elizabeth
had conscientiously heeded the caution.
The top of her desk had the appearance of
a department of a small stationery store.</p>
<p>She began her work. Dr. Kitchell walked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
up and down the room, never once turning
his eyes from them. Miss Brosius rubbed
her eye-glasses, and seating herself at the
end of the room, kept her gaze fixed upon
the back of the students&#8217; heads. Such
scrutiny was not calculated to make one feel
at ease. For one hour no sound save the
moving of pencils was heard. Then Miss
Brosius spoke. &#8220;I have a class the next
period, Dr. Kitchell,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I can stay
no longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Worden will be here in one moment
to relieve you,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;She
has a physical geography class in Room C.
It will not detain her long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even as he spoke, Miss Worden, out of
breath with her hurry, entered and took
Miss Brosius&#8217; place, while that instructor
hurried off to her class-room.</p>
<p>Elizabeth paused in her demonstration.
Here was a problem new to her. Why
could not Miss Brosius leave until Miss
Worden came in, and why did Dr. Kitchell
stride up and down, up and down, never for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
an instant removing his keen eyes from the
class before him?</p>
<p>In the daily intercourse with her parents,
she had asked questions freely. She did
now as she would have done with them. As
Dr. Kitchell passed her desk, she spoke to
him:</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not help hearing what Miss
Brosius said to you about leaving the room,
and wondered what she meant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is impossible for me to see all the students.
Unfortunately, I do not have eyes
in the back of my head.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth met his glance with a look of
surprise.</p>
<p>Dr. Kitchell then spoke more plainly.
&#8220;I am quite determined there shall be no
cheating in my classes. My students
will pass on their own merits&mdash;or not at
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Miss Brosius then&mdash;&#8221; she paused,
not feeling confident enough of the situation
to put her feelings into words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Brosius is here to assist me, and to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
see there is no copying, no cheating done in
the class.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Dr. Kitchell was an excellent man,
an able instructor, but he had a blunt way
of expressing himself. Elizabeth&#8217;s face
flushed and then grew pale. For one instant
her lips quivered and her eyes filled.
But she quickly controlled herself, and began
putting together her papers. Arising,
she was about to quit the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you finished, Miss Hobart?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I have not.&#8221; Elizabeth spoke
quietly. One could have no suspicion of the
fire that lay smoldering beneath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Finish and hand me the papers before
you leave the room. That has always been
the rule at Exeter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not intend to finish, or to hand in
my papers.&#8221; Although she spoke quietly,
her voice was heard over the class-room.
Each student paused with uplifted pencil in
her hand. For the most part, Dr. Kitchell
was feared. Few would have dared oppose
him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And why not, may I ask?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I will not stay and take an examination
where we are treated as though
we were criminals. Having a watch set
upon us is an insult to every honest student
in the class. Until I have proved myself
to be either a liar or a thief, I insist upon
being treated with respect. That is why I
will not stay to take an examination under
police supervision.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Kitchell was a big man. Elizabeth
looked so childish and little as she stood before
him that he could not suppress a smile.
He rather admired the spunky little lady
who dared to express her opinion so freely.
Yet discipline must be maintained. &#8220;You
will report to Dr. Morgan,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly shall,&#8221; was the rejoinder, as
she quitted the room.</p>
<p>In this whirl of indignation and hurt
pride, she entered her room and found
Mary there.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was coming for you, Elizabeth,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a telegram for you.&#8221; She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
held out the yellow envelope. &#8220;I hope there
is nothing serious the matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth tore it open before Mary finished
speaking, and read it quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s from father,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I do not
understand it.&#8221; She handed the paper to
Mary. &#8220;You know I was to start for home
Saturday morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary read it aloud:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not start home. Letter follows. Every one
well. Business reason for waiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing to worry about in that. My
father has often sent me just such word.
Perhaps business calls him away. You see
he says every one is well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And he would not say that unless it were
absolutely true,&#8221; said Elizabeth with conviction.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have the letter by to-morrow&#8217;s
mail. It&#8217;s something pleasant, depend
upon it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so.&#8221; She sank down despondently
into a chair and rested her head upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
the study-table. &#8220;I wish something pleasant
would happen. This is &#8216;blue&#8217; week for
me. Yesterday I became excited and almost
said too much, and to-day I rush madly
in and mix up affairs in the math. exams.
I told Dr. Kitchell what I thought of his
method of conducting them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary&#8217;s eyes grew bright. They fairly
danced in surprise at Elizabeth&#8217;s action.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, even I would not have dared do
that,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have dared everything
at Exeter but Dr. Kitchell. I would as
soon think of going to Dr. Morgan and telling
her that I do not approve of her method
of conducting Exeter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is about what I will do next,&#8221; said
Elizabeth dolefully. &#8220;When one begins
anything like this, there is no telling where
she will end. Oh, dear, I&#8217;ll be glad to get
home where people know me, and don&#8217;t act
as though they expect me to lie or steal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one thinks that here, Elizabeth.
You&#8217;ve run up against a snag. We all have
our blue days when we wish we were somewhere
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
else, and when we have a poor opinion
of every one, ourselves included.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You never do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, often, but I found it didn&#8217;t pay to
give up to them. Come, tell me all the trouble,
and when it&#8217;s all told you may find
there&#8217;s very little of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could think so. I&#8217;ll tell you,
Mary, and then I&#8217;ll go and see Dr. Morgan.
I&#8217;m to report immediately to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>She proceeded with her tale of woe. And
although her listener was sympathetic, she
laughed heartily during the recital.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h3>MIDNIGHT CONFIDENCES.</h3>
</div>

<p>On going to the office, Elizabeth found
that Dr. Morgan had been called unexpectedly
to the city, and would not return for
several days. She was disappointed, as she
much preferred having the thing over and
done with than hanging fire for several
days. The girls crowded about her, expressing
both admiration and criticism and
offering advice until Elizabeth did not know
whether she was a culprit or a heroine.
The maddening part of it was that she must
wait three days to find out. Her own opinion
in regard to being &#8220;policed&#8221; into honesty
had not changed. She felt confident of
the support of her father in the position she
had taken. She knew how, from the bottom
of his heart, he abhorred any questioning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
of one&#8217;s honor. The more she listened
to the talk of the other girls, the more indignant
she was at the insult.</p>
<p>She was not one to give expression to her
feeling in words only. After her remarks
to Dr. Kitchell, the other girls did most of
the talking while she listened, turning the
matter over in her mind. She had her
father&#8217;s way of straightening matters out.
&#8220;If a thing is wrong, make it right&mdash;if you
can,&#8221; she had often heard him say to Joe
Ratowsky. Her four months at Exeter had
taught her there were people of words and
people of action. It was of the last-named
class she selected her helpers. Landis was
not to be considered. It is doubtful if she
could have given a reason for the feeling
that she would be of no assistance in a reform
movement. It was merely intuition
and could not be put into words. Min, too,
who was but the shadow of Landis, was to
be barred. There was enough to begin with&mdash;Anna
Cresswell, Nancy Eckdahl, Mary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
Wilson, Mame Welch, Nora O&#8217;Day, strange
to say, and herself.</p>
<p>At the dinner table, Elizabeth passed the
word around asking the girls to come to her
room immediately at the ringing of the
study bell. Some of the students were already
packing to leave for the holidays; and
after the midwinter examinations, no strict
observance was paid to study hours.</p>
<p>Miss Brosius heard the invitation and
smiled. She was learning to know Miss
Hobart. After the experience of the morning,
she felt these summonses might be followed
by a declaration of war. Her position
in regard to overseeing examinations
was more distasteful to her than it could
possibly be to any of the students. But
from time immemorial such had been the
custom of most schools. There must have
been a reason for it. No doubt, it had been
forced upon the instructors by the attitude
of the students themselves. New conditions
may have arisen, but the old law still
held.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something brewing,&#8221; Miss Brosius
said to Miss Watson as they quitted the
dining-hall. &#8220;If I read the stars aright,
Exeter Hall will be reformed before Dr.
Morgan returns from the city.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She comes to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe. Reforms have started in less
than twenty-four hours. The fuel has been
ready for several years, waiting for someone
to apply the match.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is doing that now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Elizabeth Hobart, if I am not mistaken.
Did you not notice the flash of her eyes and
the message she was passing about to have
the girls meet in her room?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but I thought it was nothing more
than a taffy pull.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a deep-laid plot to reform us all. I
must give her credit in the selection of her
colleagues. She has picked those who will
carry her plans through if they once see fit
to accept them. Oh, no, don&#8217;t be alarmed,&#8221;
as she noticed Miss Watson&#8217;s expression,
&#8220;there may come some good from it; no evil
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
at least, I&#8217;m sure. It may be a good thing
to have them talk the matter over.&#8221; Then
she related the events of the morning.</p>
<p>The girls did not know the reason for
their being called together. Nora O&#8217;Day,
to Elizabeth&#8217;s surprise, made no objections,
Elizabeth having explained fully that it was
not a social but a purely business meeting.
Nora came in after the others had gathered.
With a nod to them collectively, she took
her place before the grate.</p>
<p>Elizabeth stated the reason of the gathering.
She related the scene of the morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know I never was in an examination
before,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You have no idea
how it impressed me. To think of having
two and three teachers in the room to watch
us! Why, it seemed to me it was the most
insulting thing possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is because it is new to you. It
really was not meant that way,&#8221; Miss Cresswell
explained. &#8220;But you must bear this
in mind&mdash;school life is just like outside life.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
There are some students who are dishonest.
There&#8217;s no getting around that fact. And
because of those few, we must all be put under
surveillance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth was not to be convinced. &#8220;I do
not see why. I felt this morning in class
just as I would if I had gone into Dr. Morgan&#8217;s
room and she had immediately locked
up her jewelry and her purse. Surely, the
teachers themselves must have learned by
this time who can be trusted and who can
not! Suppose among the fifty girls in our
room this morning, there were one or two
who cheated. I think it would have been
far better to allow them to go their way
than have treated us all like criminals.
What great difference would it make anyhow?
They would be the only losers; and
as to being watched, how is that going to
make them any better?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Wilson shook back her hair. Her
eyes were beginning to flash. As Elizabeth
discussed the question, her enthusiasm grew.</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes them worse&mdash;far worse. If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
there is anything in the world that would
make me cheat it is being watched to see
that I didn&#8217;t. I&#8217;d do it then just to prove
that I could be sharper than they.&#8221;</p>
<p>They talked the matter over thoroughly,
each one, with the exception of Nora O&#8217;Day,
expressing herself freely. She sat silent;
but her silence did not spring from lack of
interest. She listened keenly to every word,
and weighed it fully before she accepted it.
Elizabeth wondered at her, for she was not
naturally quiet. The others understood,
and did not ask for her opinion.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had gained one point. The
girls did not treat Miss O&#8217;Day with that
studied formality which is more galling than
open neglect as they had on former occasions.
Mary, in particular, was quite agreeable,
and Nora herself more at ease.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had a plan for this reformation.
She was not attempting the impossible.
Her idea was practical. Even Miss Cresswell
declared it to be wise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you be secretary, Miss Cresswell,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
and jot down our plan?&#8221; asked Elizabeth.</p>
<p>She moved to the study-table, taking up a
pencil and tablet ready for work. &#8220;What
have you decided to do about talking with
the girls?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Will you call them
all together and present this plan to them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; my idea was to interview each one
by herself. It seems so much more personal
than talking to them all together. I
think they will take it so; I&#8217;m sure I
should.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps so. But it will mean a great
deal of work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will not object to the work,&#8221; said
Mary Wilson, &#8220;if we only succeed in carrying
out Elizabeth&#8217;s idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>The details were further discussed. Then
they began to apportion a certain section of
the Hall for each girl to visit.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need not visit them all. Each new
recruit will be put to work to get other signers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anna Cresswell continued her writing.
At last she spoke. &#8220;We will have this run
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
off on the typewriter. Listen. Is this just
what you intend, Elizabeth?&#8221; She read:</p>
<p>&#8220;We, the undersigned students of Exeter
Hall, not being contented with the present
method of conducting examinations, believing
that it casts reflections upon the honor of
each student, do hereby suggest a means of
reformation. We pledge ourselves individually
to receive no assistance at such times.
Furthermore, we will quietly but firmly discountenance
among the students any methods
not strictly honorable.</p>
<p>&#8220;We respectfully request Dr. Morgan to
have examinations conducted hereafter
without the presence of instructors, we
pledging ourselves that under our supervision
they will reflect credit both upon Exeter
and the students.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have done it beautifully. My
father could not have done it better,&#8221; said
Elizabeth. &#8220;Now we must get the names
of the best girls at Exeter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t have a name of one who does not
mean to keep her pledge,&#8221; advised Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
Cresswell. &#8220;Fifty people in earnest are
worth more than an hundred, half of whom
veer with the wind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But as Anna Cresswell said before,&#8221; began
Mary Wilson excitedly, &#8220;there will be
some who will cheat. What will we do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the girls will agree to this, and
the majority can be depended upon to do as
they pledge themselves. If you keep your
eyes open in the class-room, you can soon
discover who has no sense of honor. These
may be taken quietly aside and spoken to.
If they transgress a second time, we will
make the affair public.&#8221; This advice came
from Miss Cresswell.</p>
<p>At the close of her speech, Mame Welch
arose. &#8220;If we don&#8217;t scatter soon, the lights
will be out, and I do not care to wander
down the staircase in the dark. I did it
once, and I had a bump on my head for a
week. One&#8217;s head is not the best &#8216;lighting&#8217;
place. Come, Carrie Hirsch, you go my
way. If the lights go out, we will fall together.&#8221;
Slipping her arm through Carrie&#8217;s,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
and bidding the others good-night, she
quitted the room.</p>
<p>Miss Cresswell and Nancy followed, with
cheery words to encourage Mary and Elizabeth
for to-morrow&#8217;s work. Nora O&#8217;Day
remained. She was quite a striking figure
as she stood leaning with her elbow against
the mantel, looking down into the grate. As
always, she was richly dressed. Her loose
robe of crimson silk, her dark hair hanging
in a single braid, and her olive-tinted skin
presented a glowing picture.</p>
<p>&#8220;I waited until the others left,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;to speak to you alone, Elizabeth. I have
been wishing to for several days, but you
were so busy, I didn&#8217;t feel that I could take
you from your work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can talk together here. I am going
into the bedroom,&#8221; said Mary, making ready
to disappear.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I do not wish to disturb you. I intended
asking Elizabeth to walk to the end
of the hall with me. I love to sit on the
window-seat at the landing. The campus is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
beautiful in the moonlight. No one is disturbed
by the talking there. I think Mrs.
Schuyler will not mind late hours to-night,
since we go home to-morrow. Will you
come, Elizabeth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; wait one minute until I get a wrap.
That window-seat is full of drafts, I know.
I have sat there before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taking down a golf cape, she wrapped it
about her. &#8220;Come,&#8221; she added, drawing
Miss O&#8217;Day&#8217;s arm through her own. &#8220;We
will be night-hawks until Mrs. Schuyler
finds us. Don&#8217;t lock the door, Mary. I&#8217;ll
slip in later.&#8221;</p>
<p>A delightfully broad window-seat filled
with cushions was at the turn of the stairway,
where one had a view of the campus,
now snow covered, beautiful in the glimmer
of the moonlight.</p>
<p>Arranging the cushions here to her satisfaction,
Nora began the conversation.
&#8220;I heard you talk in the meeting yesterday,
Elizabeth, and I wish to thank
you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why thank me? I only said what I
thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some girls might have done considerably
less&mdash;to my knowledge some of them
have. You ran the risk of being unpopular,
and yet you were willing to take that
risk because you were my friend. That is
the kind of friendship that is worth having.
You do not know how pleased, how glad I
was! Why, I had not been so happy for
months.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take the risk! Because I was your
friend! Well, I must be awfully dense, but
really, Nora, I haven&#8217;t the faintest idea
what you are trying to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You say that to escape my thanks&mdash;my
gratitude. That is just your way. I might
have expected as much. You do a generous,
noble deed and then slip away from the
gratitude that follows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it may be my way, and it may not.
I do not know what you are talking about.
If I have done what you call a generous, noble
deed, this is the first I have heard of it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
If your mind is still upon the speech I made
yesterday, you may be sure there was nothing
noble about that. Why, you have no
idea how angry I was! It made me so indignant
to hear some explain what should
be done and how. I didn&#8217;t approve of their
plans at all, so the only thing left for me to
do was to say what I thought about it. It
is news to me that being indignant and expressing
yourself rather&mdash;well, rather forcibly,
is noble and generous. Though,&#8221;
dryly, &#8220;I&#8217;m rather glad it is so, for it will
be easy for me to be noble in that fashion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss O&#8217;Day turned to look closely at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, Elizabeth, upon your honor now,
did you really not have me in mind when
you made that speech yesterday?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not, &#8217;pon honor,&#8221; she laughed
softly. Then she gave Miss O&#8217;Day&#8217;s hand
a very loving squeeze to mitigate the hurt
her next words might contain. &#8220;It may be
rather galling to your pride, but I did not
even think of you after we entered the meeting,
although I suppose you must have been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
sitting by me. I was all eyes and ears for
what was going on up front. I suppose you
might add all mouth, too, for that matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you did not know what happened
here last spring? Did none of the girls tell
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know what particular happenings
you have in mind. But no one told me
of anything that was unusual.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then I shall tell you. It was not
until last evening that I felt that I could
talk the matter over with any one; but after
you spoke as you did, I knew that you could
understand. I have borne it so long without
letting any one know, that it is a relief
to think I can tell just how I feel, and how
awful these months at Exeter have been. I
might have gone somewhere else this fall
and not returned at all; but when I thought
it over, it seemed to me that it would be
cowardly to slip away like that. Last summer
I wrote to Dr. Morgan that I intended
returning. Then I made up my mind that
I would stay here until I made every one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
at Exeter, from Dr. Morgan down to the
dining-hall girls, respect me.&#8221; She paused,
then added slowly, &#8220;But I don&#8217;t seem to
have made much headway yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a sadness in the girl&#8217;s voice
which embarrassed Elizabeth. She knew
that Nora O&#8217;Day was sad&mdash;had known that
for a long time. She would have been glad
to express sympathy, say some word which
would show confidence in her companion,
but she was so new to anything of this sort
that she could do nothing but sit silent and
look at her. Then she suddenly blurted
out:</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know what you are talking
about! Tell me, Nora. I fancy it is not
really so bad as you think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not see how it could be worse!
Perhaps, when I tell you, you will feel as
the others. If you do, don&#8217;t stop to explain
and give all kinds of reasons for your actions.
Just walk off, and I will understand
that you do not care to be friends
with me. I&#8217;ll not be surprised. Indeed, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
rather expect you to do just that thing&mdash;yet,
after all, you have always been different.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, wait until I walk off. I may not.
Dollars to doughnuts, the &#8216;awful&#8217; thing you
have done is partly imaginary. The girls
are all right, and I love <i>some</i> of them; but
even that doesn&#8217;t make me think them infallible.
But you sit there and hint about
a dreadful deed you have done. One would
think you were little less than a female Captain
Kidd. There are cold chills running
up and down my spine now, so begin quick
and tell me everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Last spring, I went into the geometry
examination and took my book with me. I
copied three theorems, letter for letter,
right out of the book. A half-dozen girls
saw me&mdash;Mary Wilson, Nancy, Carrie
Hirsch, Mame Welch, Landis and Min.
That same evening the girls met and
decided to cut me. We had all been
friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think Mary or Nancy would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
have done that&mdash;meet and talk over such a
matter in public.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t. Neither would Carrie or
Mame. I know none of the four were at
the meeting. I think each one of them
thought the matter over and decided for herself.
They speak to me at the table and
any school meetings. But that is a small
part of Exeter life. They never enter my
room or invite me into theirs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who called the meeting of the girls?&#8221;
Elizabeth asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Min Kean. I am positive of that, because
the notices were signed by her. That
is required before any meeting can be held.
Then Dr. Morgan knows where to place the
responsibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth gave a gesture of disapproval.
She was about to speak, but checked herself,
deciding that criticism was not going to
help the matter. Nora noticed her hesitancy,
and attributed it to a different motive.</p>
<p>&#8220;What were you going to say? Do not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
hesitate. I deserve criticism. I am not
afraid to hear it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not a criticism of you. I was
thinking that Min Kean must have been a
different person last term. I could not, although
I stretched my imagination to its
limit, think of her as taking the lead in any
matter. What part did Landis take?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know. No one ventured to tell
me and I would not ask. Before we left
Exeter in the spring, she came into my room
and stayed almost all of the evening. She
told me that she thought the girls acted impulsively,
and that she had done what she
could to have them wait and consider; but
she was only one among many. She was
acting-president at that meeting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where was Anna Cresswell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She was here, but would not attend.
Someone told me that she refused to be present.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Landis ever come again to see you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very often this semester. I have all
the essays and papers my mother wrote
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
when she was a student at Arlington Seminary.
People who remember her say she
was gifted in that line. Of course, I do not
know, for she died when I was a baby.
Somehow I never had the heart to read
them, although I have saved every one.
Landis says they are quite good, and Landis,
you know, has some ability in that line herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth smiled. She was beginning to
understand. New ideas burst upon her
suddenly. Unconscious of the meaning
which might be given to her words, she said,
&#8220;I&#8217;m just beginning to learn that it is not
wise to take any one&#8217;s opinion in regard to
any one else. You must trust and be deceived,
and trust again, and just go on learning
people for yourself. Did Anna Cresswell
never come to see you? I should think
she would since she refused to attend the
meeting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She came twice to ask me to go somewhere
with her, once for a drive, and once
to walk, but each time I refused. I felt so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
badly that I had no courage to go out among
the girls. It was only a few weeks before
we were to go home. I made up my mind
to bear it until school was out and then not
come back. But I changed my mind, as I
told you. She did not ask me again. But
I did not expect that for she is very busy
with extra work. I suppose she thinks it
has all passed away. She doesn&#8217;t run about
to spreads and high teas, so she may not
have discovered that I am not among those
present.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth was silent. She was thinking,
not of her companion&#8217;s misdeed, but of the
part which Landis had probably played
throughout the affair. Nora waited for her
to speak, but receiving no answer put another
question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you, too, so disgusted with me that
you can&#8217;t bear to speak of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; slowly, &#8220;I am not disgusted. But
you certainly cannot expect me to grow enthusiastic
or praise you for cheating. I
don&#8217;t like dishonesty in any form; but I do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
not know that it is my place to pass judgment
on you. I may criticise that in you;
someone else will find something to criticise
in me. One thing I am quite sure of. You
are sorry as sorry can be that you did it;
and you will never be guilty of cheating
again, even if you know that you will fail
and be compelled to go to school here forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may be sure of that. One experience
ended such methods for me.&#8221; There
was nothing conciliatory in her tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will be honest with you, Nora. I am
disappointed in you, but I&#8217;m glad you told
me. You may be quite sure this will make
no difference in our friendship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Much to Elizabeth&#8217;s surprise, Nora, instead
of replying, began to sob, and it was
some minutes before she could speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;I appreciate this, Elizabeth. I know I
did wrong, and I have spent six months in
being sorry. Yet I do not believe I should
be censured so much as some of you if you
had done the same thing. That is rather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
an odd thing to say, I know. But when I
tell you all, you will understand just what
I mean. My mother died when I was a few
weeks old. She belonged to an excellent
family, an only child. Somehow,&#8221; the girl
hesitated. It was difficult to explain without
seeming critical of one parent. &#8220;Somehow,
my father never cared much for what
mother cared for most. He could not see
anything wrong in cards, and wine-parties,
and things like that. When mother died
grandmother Loraine took me. But she did
not live long. Then I went back home and
lived with a housekeeper and the servants.
Sometimes they were honest and sometimes
not. Mrs. Gager took charge of me. She
was a very clean old German woman and
not afraid of work, but was not refined.
She couldn&#8217;t even read. I am not complaining,
for she was as good to me as she knew
how to be. Nothing that I wanted was too
much trouble. She was really my slave,
and made every one around the house step
when I spoke.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I was a little tyrant. Father spent a
great deal of time from home, for he was a
very busy man. But he spoiled me, too. I
had but to stamp my foot and he would let
me do what I wished. He really could not
deny me anything, and he doesn&#8217;t yet. You
see, I am the only person in the world he has
left, and he thinks I am simply wonderful.&#8221;
She laughed lightly. &#8220;I am always amused
when I hear him talk to anyone of me. It
is nice, though, to have someone think of
you in that way. He is wholly sincere. He
really believes I&#8217;m the brightest and most
attractive girl at Exeter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Gager used to drink occasionally.
At such times&mdash;I must have been eight years
old&mdash;she told me what excuses to make to
father for her and how to keep Maggie, the
second maid, from knowing it. Strange as
it may seem, this old woman was my ideal.
I never hesitated to carry her false messages,
and there was a constant succession
of small deceptions. When I was able to
fool Maggie, I was commended.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>&#8220;When I grew older, I met a great number
of business men&mdash;some of whom were
my father&#8217;s traveling salesmen. And they
always made a point of telling how sharp
they had been in their transactions. I know
now that they were merely dishonest. I do
not know whether father approved or not.
They told these stories to entertain me and
not when they were talking business with
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father was always liberal. I spend as
much as I wish. He never questions how,
but gives me whatever I ask.</p>
<p>&#8220;The conversation I generally heard
among the servants&mdash;and I spent most of
my time with them&mdash;was comments on how
well or how shabby some one dressed, and
how much or how little money people had.
Don&#8217;t blame my father for neglecting me.
He hired the best servants he could, and did
what he thought was for my good. I was
well clothed and fed; and Mrs. Gager took
excellent care of my health. His business
kept him away from home. And, anyhow,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
men are not like women. A woman would
have understood at once that I needed something
more than clothes and food.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose we can&#8217;t understand,&#8221; said
Elizabeth. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve always
had a mother. She would punish me severely
if I ever deceived anyone. My
father, too, and Miss Hale are the same way.
I was brought up to abhor anything that
wasn&#8217;t honest. But, then,&#8221; reflectively,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll not take much credit to myself for that.
It was my training&mdash;not me. If I&#8217;m truthful
and all that, it&#8217;s because of my parents.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I saw no great harm in copying my
examinations, it is because I had been no better
taught. It was a surprise to learn that
every one looked upon such an act with contempt.
I would not do such a thing now.
Not because I wish to curry favor with Mary
Wilson and her set, but because I feel it is
wrong.&#8221; She paused awhile and then continued,
&#8220;I think I am like the Loraines in
that. My mother would have died before
she would have knowingly done wrong.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></p>
<p>The talk went on in this strain for some
time. Then Elizabeth spoke of the telegram
she had received and suggested that she
might not go home during the holidays.</p>
<p>Nora offered her sympathy. She did not
ask Elizabeth where she lived. It was odd
that, although they were friends, she never
knew until the close of school that Joseph
Hobart, the expert mining engineer of Bitumen,
was Elizabeth&#8217;s father.</p>
<p>It was quite late when Elizabeth slipped
back into her bedroom. She undressed
in the dark so that she might not waken
her roommate, but Mary heard her and
spoke:</p>
<p>&#8220;You and Nora O&#8217;Day must have had a
great deal to say. &#8216;Smiles&#8217; has trotted down
here twice inquiring for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you tell her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That I was not your keeper. I think
she will interview you privately to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary, there&#8217;s something I wish to ask
you. At the meeting last spring, who was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
it that worked up the case against Nora
O&#8217;Day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Landis. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, because. Are you sure? Did she
take an active part?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I&#8217;m sure. Could you imagine a
meeting where Landis didn&#8217;t put in her oar?
Why do you ask?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I wanted to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An excellent reason,&#8221; was the sleepy response.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Mary&mdash;&#8221; But Mary was asleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h3>JOE&#8217;S MESSAGE.</h3>
</div>

<p>After breakfast the following morning,
Elizabeth was summoned to the reception-hall
where Joe Ratowsky awaited her. He
stood twisting his hat about as she entered.
The expansive smile which covered his
swarthy face was not so much one of goodwill
as embarrassment. He stood in the
center of the room so that by no possible
chance could he touch any article of furniture.
Joe was no coward. He had performed
heroic parts when mobs of miners
and the militia, during the big strikes, met
in conflict. But the thought of sitting down
on chairs upholstered in satin of dainty colors
made the cold chills run up and down
his spine.</p>
<p>It was cruel in Elizabeth to shake his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
hand so long and so vigorously, even though
she was glad to see him. And it was worse
than cruel to keep pushing easy chairs before
him and insisting upon him sitting
down. Elizabeth insisted, and in desperation
Joe took a letter from his pocket and
thrust it before her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mees-ter Hobart, he write&mdash;he write
heap&mdash;b&#8217;gosh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t sick, Joe, is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sick!&#8221; Joe grunted his disgust at the
thought of anyone being sick. &#8220;He well, so
well&mdash;he get fat, b&#8217;gosh, so fat, Meester
O&#8217;Day, he look like pole he come long Meester
Hobart, b&#8217;gosh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe nodded his head vigorously, a habit he
had of emphasizing any statement he wished
to make particularly strong. Elizabeth
could not restrain a smile at the comparison.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is mother well, too, Joe?&#8221; Joe nodded
vigorously while he wiped his brow.</p>
<p>&#8220;She well like the tivil, b&#8217;gosh. Yes,
b&#8217;gosh, she so well as that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, Joe, why is it they do not
wish me to go home?&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe flung out his hand as though what he
was about to say was a mere trifle, not
worthy her consideration.</p>
<p>&#8220;The miner&mdash;not so glad, b&#8217;gosh. They
no work&mdash;no&mdash;no work. They say they tear
up railroad, b&#8217;gosh. Meester Hobart, he
say, &#8216;No tear up road.&#8217; Joe Ratowsky, he
say, &#8216;No tear up road.&#8217; All time keep watch
so no tear up road. You not come. Mebbe
no road, mebbe all right, b&#8217;gosh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A strike, Joe? Do you mean the miners
threaten to destroy the road?&#8221; He nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;No strike now, b&#8217;gosh. Colowski, he
say, &#8216;Strike.&#8217; Then all say, &#8216;Strike.&#8217; Joe
Ratowsky, he give him one between his eyes
like this.&#8221; He doubled up his fist, showing
how peace had been restored. &#8220;He no say
strike then. He crawl off. He no come
round for day and day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they go back to work then?&#8221; Elizabeth
was excited. All her life she had
heard of the horrors of a prolonged strike.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
From childhood she had a dim recollection
of someone taking her from her warm bed,
and running across fields, seeking safety
miles away. As in a dream, she could hear
the roar of hoarse voices and see the flickering
torches of the mob.</p>
<p>Joe shook his head slowly. &#8220;No, b&#8217;gosh.
They mad like the tivil. They go back some
day, so many tollars, every day for work.
No more,&#8221; shaking his head in negation,
&#8220;No, no more, b&#8217;gosh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth grew anxious. She seized Mr.
Ratowsky&#8217;s coat sleeve.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Joe, tell me truly, is my father in
danger? They won&#8217;t hurt him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;B&#8217;gosh, no. He safe like anything.
They no mad like the tivil at him. Emery
they mad at.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Mr. Emery there?&#8221; Again Joe shook
his head. &#8220;Meester Emery, he go over
ocean. He no come back, mebbe so long till
summer. When he come back, the miners
so mad they treat him like the tivil, b&#8217;gosh.&#8221;</p>
<p>This Mr. Emery, of whom he spoke, was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
one of the operators of the soft-coal region;
a man who visited the miners once in a dozen
years and of whom his workmen knew little.</p>
<p>Joe had evidently been instructed how
much to tell Elizabeth in regard to the trouble.
Being assured that her father was not
in danger, her mind turned toward the letter,
her eyes following her thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;I go back quick. I tell Meester Hobart
you look well like everything.&#8221; He shook
his head vigorously to assure her how fine a
message he would carry. &#8220;I will, b&#8217;gosh,&#8221;
he repeated.</p>
<p>He made his way to the door, keeping his
eyes upon the chairs and tables in his path.
He sighed with relief when he had passed
them, and saw a line of retreat open before
him. He continued to repeat the message
he would carry to her father.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grow so tall likes nothing. He will be
so glad like the tivil. I tells him so. Yes,
he will, b&#8217;gosh.&#8221; These were his parting
words as the door closed upon him.</p>
<p>The greater number of the girls in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
dormitory hall had packed or were packing
their trunks. The hallway was obstructed
with baggage of all descriptions, awaiting
the coming of Jimmy Jordan and his train
of helpers.</p>
<p>Mary Wilson was to leave Exeter immediately
after lunch. She had begun her preparations
before breakfast. Elizabeth, taking
it for granted that their rooms would
yet be in confusion, went down to the window-seat
where she and Nora had sat the
night before, in order to read her letter in
quiet. There was nothing unusual in it&mdash;nothing
to startle her, at least; the home
news was told with her father&#8217;s usual buoyant
spirit. If he were harassed or annoyed,
his letter writing did not show it. It was
not until all the bright little bits of home
life had been related that he mentioned the
trouble at the mines&mdash;just a little local trouble,
nothing general. Both her mother and
he thought it best that she should not go up
the mountain railroad this time of year.
There was nothing at all to alarm her. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
was to spend her holidays with any one of
the girls whom Dr. Morgan advised. It was
difficult on account of the snow to get the
mails through. She must not be anxious if
her accustomed letter did not arrive on
time.</p>
<p>As was her habit with home letters, Elizabeth
read and re-read it. She was slipping
it back into its envelope when Landis and
Min appeared. Both were dressed for traveling.
They stopped to enquire of Elizabeth
when she expected to leave Exeter, being
surprised to see her sitting there in her
school dress when the others were either
packing or already leaving. She told them
the possibility of her remaining at the Hall
for the holiday season. At this Landis
wrinkled her brow in perplexity, and pondered
awhile in deep thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was trying to see my way clear to ask
you to go with me to The Beeches&mdash;my
home, so called because of the magnificent
trees which grow near our residence. But
I do not see how I can manage it now. I do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
wish I had known about this sooner. I
might have been able to arrange matters
somehow. I do not like the idea of your
being here alone. Exeter is dull with the
girls gone. It&#8217;s really unbearable. But I
have arranged to go home with Min until
the day before Christmas. We always have
a big family party for that day, and our
home is filled. I suppose we could tuck you
in somewhere&mdash;if you do not object to the
third floor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, do not think of it, I beg you,&#8221; began
Elizabeth hurriedly. Somehow Exeter
without company seemed better to her
than The Beeches with Landis. &#8220;I would
not for the world cause you any inconvenience.
Besides, the matter is in the hands
of Dr. Morgan. I must do as she decides.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I hope she will see fit to send you
off somewhere. Come to think of it, I do
believe I could not let you have even a third
floor room. Our cook always takes the
privilege of asking in some of her relations,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
and that leaves no space unfilled. I wish it
were otherwise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are kind to think of it. But I could
not go in any event. I must go back to my
room now. Mary is deep in her packing
and will need me. When do you leave?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not until afternoon. But we are going
into the city. Shall we see you before we
leave?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Good-byes were said, and Elizabeth went
to her room. She was disappointed at not
being able to go home, but had no fear of a
possible strike, or any danger to her father.
Joe Ratowsky had reassured her, and besides
her faith in her own father made her
confident. There was no question in her
mind about his being popular with the miners.
He had been not only their superintendent,
but physician, friend and banker.</p>
<p>Having packed her trunk so full that the
lid would not close, Mary was jumping up
and down on it when Elizabeth entered.
She hailed her with an exclamation of delight.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you weigh something!
Come, sit on my trunk while I turn the key.
I can get the lid down, but it springs open
the instant I get off, and I cannot stand up
there and turn the key at the same time. I
have been bouncing on it for the last half-hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her cheeks were flushed and her eyes
bright from her strenuous efforts. Elizabeth
did as requested. The trunk closed
with a snap.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; asked Mary, &#8220;when do you
begin to pack? I suppose your Polish
friend brought you news from home. I hurried
to get my belongings out of the way that
you might begin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not until next June,&#8221; was the reply.
Then sitting down on the trunk beside Mary,
she related the messages which Joe had
brought, and the advice which her father&#8217;s
letter contained.</p>
<p>Mary listened without comment until the
story was finished. Then she tossed back
her hair, and without a word hurried to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
door, flung it open with a great disregard
for the amount of noise she was making and
began hauling in Elizabeth&#8217;s trunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have just three hours to pack, dress,
eat and get down to the station,&#8221; she said,
unbuckling straps and removing trays as she
spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t stop to talk or ask questions, or
say you can&#8217;t.&#8221; Mary stopped long enough
to stamp her foot in order to emphasize her
words. &#8220;You&#8217;re going home with me.
We&#8217;ll talk it over afterward. We haven&#8217;t
time now. I&#8217;ll hear the objections to-morrow.
Put on your duds, and I&#8217;ll pack, while
you get yourself ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready except my coat and hat.&#8221;
She was carrying Elizabeth&#8217;s clothes from
the wardrobe, and placing them in the trunk.
Elizabeth did as she was told without questioning
further. She was only too glad to
be taken possession of, for the thought of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
Exeter Hall without the girls had not been
pleasant.</p>
<p>The trunk was packed and her dressing
about completed when Nora O&#8217;Day entered.
She was dressed in a handsome traveling
suit, the product of a city importer. As
usual, she carried her lithe, slender body
proudly, as though no one was quite her
equal. Elizabeth understood the girl now
and knew that her defiant attitude was assumed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come in to say goodbye. I haven&#8217;t
a minute. The cab is waiting for me.&#8221;
She shook hands with Mary. Then turned
to embrace Elizabeth. There was a great
deal of affection in her manner toward this
new friend. &#8220;We were talking last night of
mother&#8217;s theses. I put some together for
you to take with you to read. I really think
you will enjoy them. I know you will be
careful of them. I mean to keep them all
and some day read them over.&#8221; She kissed
Elizabeth again, and with a hurried goodbye
was gone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>Elizabeth appreciated this remembrance
more than a gift of greater money value.
Nora cherished these papers the most of all
her possessions, and she gave her best when
she confided them to Elizabeth. Slipping
them into the tray of the trunk, she turned
to the mirror to arrange her collar. At last
turning to Mary, she said, &#8220;There, I&#8217;m
clothed and in my right mind, and we yet
have half an hour. Now we must report to
Dr. Morgan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are evidently clothed,&#8221; was the response,
&#8220;but I&#8217;m not sure about the right
mind. Don&#8217;t you remember that Dr. Morgan
does not return until to-night? By that
time we will be home. I&#8217;ll speak to Miss
Brosius as we go down to lunch. She&#8217;s the
high-monkey-monk here when our Ph. D.
is roaming. We have no time to waste.
Jordan will see to the trunks and tickets.
He always does. Put on your wraps.
We&#8217;ll eat our lunch with them on. It is no
use coming back up-stairs. There are but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
few of the girls left. We&#8217;ll bid them goodbye
down-stairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not until then that Elizabeth had
time to think about going to Mary&#8217;s home.
Then she stopped and suddenly put the question:
&#8220;Perhaps your mother will not want
me, Mary. She&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on! Of course, she&#8217;ll want you.
She is always glad to have company. She
would not be pleased if I came home and left
you here alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it might inconvenience her,&#8221; she began
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing ever inconveniences my mother.
She won&#8217;t allow it to. The only trouble we
have is that our girls take sudden notions to
go off and marry, and sometimes we do not
have anyone to do the work. I think Fanny
intended being married during the holidays.
If she does, you and I will have a position
as dishwasher. Can you wash dishes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I always do at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we may have to do it. But we
will have a good time. When the servants
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
take to themselves wings we all help, and
such fun as we do have! A little matter
like that never inconveniences mother.
Once during court week, our only hotel
burned. There was a big case on before
father, and he brought all the witnesses and
lawyers home. They were there three days.
Mother seemed to think it was a joke.&#8221;
Then with a look at Elizabeth, she added
with conviction, &#8220;A little bit of a girl like
<i>you</i> could not inconvenience <i>her</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Wilson home was at Windburne, a
two hours&#8217; ride from Exeter with a change
of cars at Ridgway.</p>
<p>It was extremely cold when the girls left
the Hall, but before they reached Ridgway
the mercury had gone several degrees lower.</p>
<p>The road to Windburne from the Ridgway
junction is a local affair, narrow
gauge, with little rocking cars in which a
tall person could scarcely stand upright.
Windburne is the county-seat and consequently
a place of importance, but Ridgway
has little traffic and the roads intersecting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
there take no pains to make close connections.</p>
<p>It was three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon
when the girls reached the junction, a bleak
little place with a low-roofed station, black
and dirty. A hotel stood at the corner&mdash;a
rough saloon. An engine with a coach usually
waited on this narrow gauge track, but
this afternoon there was none. Before she
entered the waiting-room Miss Wilson
looked about, expressing her surprise at the
condition of affairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The worst is yet to come,&#8221; cried a voice
back of them. The girls turned to discover
the ticket agent, just about to leave for
home.</p>
<p>&#8220;The narrow gauge is storm-stayed.
You will not be able to go through to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll turn about and go to Exeter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to-night. The last train pulled out
just before No. 10 came in. There&#8217;s a hotel
over there&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we <i>smelled</i> it,&#8221; said Elizabeth seriously.</p>
<p>He laughed, and inquired where they
were going. Then he suggested a plan.
The hotel was not a suitable place in which
to spend the night, and they could not return
to Exeter; but he would find for them
a trustworthy driver who would take them
safely to Windburne.</p>
<p>There was no choice. Mary accepted his
offer. The girls stayed in the dingy waiting-room
until he returned with a sleigh, horses
and driver.</p>
<p>&#8220;This man will take you there safely,&#8221;
he said, with a nod toward the driver.
&#8220;He knows the road and knows, too, how to
handle horses to get the most out of them.&#8221;
He assisted the girls into the sleigh, tucking
the robes well about them. A moment
later, they were speeding along the country
road. The sleighing was fine but the wind
had a clear sweep over the bare fields, and
it had grown much colder. They began to
shiver in spite of their heavy wraps.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We are over half-way there,&#8221; encouraged
Mary. &#8220;The farmhouse we have
just passed is six miles from Ridgway. I
know the roads about here. This is beautiful
in summer time. Landis Stoner lives
in the last farmhouse along this road.
After we pass there, we won&#8217;t see another
for five miles, and when we do it will be
Windburne. There, you can catch a
glimpse of the place now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t we stop and get warm?&#8221; asked
Elizabeth, her teeth chattering. &#8220;My feet
are numb!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; perhaps it would be better. We&#8217;ll
get Mrs. Stoner to heat bricks for our feet.
She&#8217;s very hospitable, and will make us
comfortable.&#8221; She leaned over to speak to
the driver, requesting him to stop at the
Stoner place.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was too cold to look about her
as they entered the house. She was conscious
only that an immense beech was
stretching its bare boughs before the doorway,
then someone was leading her to an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
easy chair, removing her wraps and rubbing
her hands to make them warm. In a few
minutes she was herself. Mrs. Stoner had
brought them hot coffee, and was now putting
bricks into the fireplace.</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked upon her in surprise.
This was not the style of woman she had
pictured in her mind as Landis&#8217; mother.
She was a faded, slender little body, mild
and gentle in manner and voice. One felt
that she was refined and had devoted the
best of her life to serving others. She was
dressed in a plain dark calico, which had
seen better days, yet its absolute cleanliness
and the band of white at her throat gave her
an air of being well-dressed.</p>
<p>The room, evidently the best in the house,
was homey and comfortable. There was an
open fireplace big enough to accommodate a
four-foot log, a bright rag carpet, and some
wooden rockers with easy cushions. The
windows had white sash curtains. In one
were pots of blooming geraniums.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never been at Exeter,&#8221; Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
Stoner said. &#8220;Of course, I have heard of
it all my life. As a young girl, I used to
dream what a fine thing it would be to go
there to school. But it was not to be.
Landis, however, is having that privilege,
and I am very thankful. Miss Rice&mdash;you
have met her; every one hereabouts has&mdash;thinks
that every girl should have a little
more than they get in public schools.
She&#8217;s made it possible for Landis to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their hostess then brought out some pictures
Landis had sent home&mdash;kodak views
of the girls, their rooms, and the campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; she added with a smile, &#8220;although
I have never been at Exeter, I know
it well. Landis writes of the teachers and
her girl friends until I feel I know them
thoroughly.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the mother continued, her pale face
lighting up, Elizabeth saw Landis in a different
light. The girl was evidently devoted
to her mother, if one could judge
from the numerous letters and the many
little souvenirs from school displayed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It was dull for Landis here,&#8221; she continued.
&#8220;There is no company for miles,
and only her father and I at home. She
did not want to leave us. But I told her
we were used to the quiet and were company
for each other. I miss her, of course, but
it would have been selfish to have kept
her here. She must live her own life and
have her own experiences, and I can&#8217;t expect
her to be satisfied with what satisfies
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hot coffee had made them comfortable;
the bricks in the grate were hot, and
the time had come to start. Solicitous of
their welfare, Mrs. Stoner brought extra
wraps, warming them at the open fire, then
securely pinning them about the girls. She
came to see them off and Elizabeth, with a
sudden impulse, kissed her warmly.</p>
<p>When they were safely in the sleigh again
and speeding over the frozen roads, she
turned to Mary with the explanation: &#8220;Do
you know, she&#8217;s really homesick to see Landis?
I couldn&#8217;t help kissing her; she&#8217;s so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
gentle and sweet that I could easily love
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned her head to catch a last
glimpse and to wave farewell to the little
woman standing in the doorway of the humble
home which Landis had called &#8220;The
Beeches.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<h3>CLOUDS AND GATHERING STORMS.</h3>
</div>

<p>Dennis O&#8217;Day, as he stood at the door of
his saloon this autumn afternoon, was an
excellent advertisement for the line of
goods he carried. He was big and flabby.
The skin about his eyes had grown into
loose sacks; his eyes were a steel-gray, cruel,
keen, crafty, without a particle of humor or
affection. He owned the largest breweries
in the state, and controlled numerous
retail houses where his products were sold.</p>
<p>His dealings were largely with the foreign
element. He spoke ready German with its
various dialects. His name indicated his
nationality. Though an Irishman he lacked
the great-heartedness of his countrymen.
The humor which made their shanties brimming
with life and fun was not for him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
He drove the Poles and Slavs who lived
about Bitumen like a herd of cattle. The
few who voted, voted as Dennis O&#8217;Day told
them. The labor problem was discussed
over his bar. He fixed for them the length
of day, and the rate per ton. He was the
bell-sheep for all the foreign herd. In return
for their allegiance, he bailed them out
of jail when necessary. When Gerani in a
drunken quarrel, had stabbed the fighting,
ugly-tempered little Italian, Marino De Angelo,
it was Dennis who established an alibi,
and swore all manner of oaths to prove that
Gerani, a law-abiding citizen, a credit to the
commonwealth, could not possibly have
done it. As to the guilty party, O&#8217;Day had
shaken his head in doubt. He was not
quick to remember the faces of these foreigners.
There were many about&mdash;some
new to him. It was impossible to point out
the guilty man. He appeared really grieved
that the death of De Angelo should go unpunished,
and left the court-room with the
avowed intent of bringing the murderer to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
justice. That had been some five years before,
and De Angelo&#8217;s murderer was yet unpunished.
But from that time, Gerani was
a slave to O&#8217;Day. There was no work
about the hotel or town that he would not
do at the saloonist&#8217;s bidding. He made
good wages in the mines and the proprietor
of &#8220;The Miner&#8217;s Rest&#8221; received the biggest
portion of them.</p>
<p>It was not for love of Landlord O&#8217;Day
the big Pole served so faithfully, for he
muttered and cursed under his breath the
instant he was out of range of the cold,
steely eyes. O&#8217;Day was not in ignorance
of this for Coslowski had warned him.
The men had been drinking, Gerani among
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep your eye on the big Polack,&#8221; he
said to Dennis, yet loud enough for all to
hear. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t want to hand in your
checks soon, don&#8217;t let him get behind you on
a dark night.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that Gerani had scowled malignantly.
O&#8217;Day laughed loud and mirthlessly, while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
he washed glasses and kept his eye on the
scowling Pole.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d do it quick enough. Dead men tell
no tales; but confessions do. And I&#8217;ve left
with Father Brady a nice lot of paper
which he&#8217;s to read when I&#8217;m gone. It
will be hot enough around here to make
more than one swing for a breeze. I&#8217;m
safe with Gerani&mdash;so long as those papers
are safe with Father Brady.&#8221; The big
Pole moved away from his place at the
front. As O&#8217;Day ceased speaking, he disappeared
into the darkness.</p>
<p>By such methods O&#8217;Day had gained his
influence over the foreigners. He was lawless.
His place was open on the Sabbath
and until all hours of the night. Young
boys entered sober and came forth drunk.
There was no one to call him to account.
Then from somewhere came Joe Ratowsky.
And from that time, the troubles of Dennis
O&#8217;Day began.</p>
<p>Yet big Joe was apparently innocent.
He could smatter only a little English. No
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
one seemed to know where he came from
and he never furnished the information
even when asked; he never seemed to hear
the question. He was friendly with his
countrymen, and stood by them whenever
the need arose. He was often called upon
to act as interpreter between the bosses and
the men, but still he was different from
those about him. He was a Pole, heart and
soul, and his faith was bound to the homeland
whose ultimate independence was his
one dream; he had risen a grade higher in
the moral scale than those whom his work
made his associates. Joe took baths. Joe
read a Polish paper; he did not drink except
one glass of beer at his dinner. None
of them had ever been able to persuade him
to go further than that. Whether it were
a wedding or a wake, Joe was staunch.
This moderation, with the baths, set him,
apart.</p>
<p>He did not mine at Bitumen, but worked
his little patch of ground, interpreted when
there was need for small consideration, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
at last opened a little restaurant where
lunches after the German style were served.
His black coffee certainly excelled O&#8217;Day&#8217;s
beer, while the wienerwurst and &#8220;Schnitz-und-Knöpf&#8221;
put to shame the meals at &#8220;The
Miner&#8217;s Rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe&#8217;s place consisted of a great room with
a bare floor, furnished with wooden chairs
and tables. One weekly paper in German
was always to be found. The German element
at Bitumen could read their own language;
and they passed the news on to the
others. The innovation of the paper
diminished the popularity of O&#8217;Day&#8217;s place.
Joe also introduced music, or what was
passed for it. Then O&#8217;Day offered to buy
him out at a price more than the place was
worth. Joe smiled blandly, &#8220;Me know Slav&mdash;me
know Polack talk. Me know no
English like you say. Me no understand.
Meester Hobart, he tell you vat you says.
He tell you quick like the tivil.&#8221; But Dennis
O&#8217;Day had no desire to speak with Mr.
Hobart. His efforts with Joe were futile.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
The big Pole had made up his mind not to
understand.</p>
<p>The superintendent was liked well
enough by the saloonist, and consequently
by the greater portion of the men. Mr.
Hobart was opposed to liquor, and had not
hesitated to express himself to that effect.
But O&#8217;Day cared little for that so long, as
he said, the man knew his place and did not
interfere. And his place, to O&#8217;Day&#8217;s way
of thinking, was to superintend the mines,
and let the morals of the men alone. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
take good care of them,&#8221; he was apt to add
with a crafty look. His intercourse with
Mr. Hobart began and ended with a bow of
recognition in the street. So far as the
liquor business was concerned, O&#8217;Day considered
the superintendent harmless, and
that was as far as he concerned himself
with anyone.</p>
<p>Some subtle influence was working
against O&#8217;Day. From whence it came he
was not able to determine. The time had
passed, however, when he could break
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
the law with impunity. He felt that keen
eyes were upon him. He was cunning
enough to know that his safety now lay in
his keeping within the limits of the law.
He made ostentatious show of closing at
the prescribed hours. All the while he kept
his eyes and ears open to discover his enemy.</p>
<p>Big Joe Ratowsky was the only probable
one. He made frequent visits to &#8220;The
Miner&#8217;s Rest,&#8221; but never drank. He knew
the ages of all the miners. In this
respect Joe&#8217;s watchfulness was clear to
O&#8217;Day&#8217;s mind; but there the evidence
stopped, and much could be said on the
other side. So, still at sea, O&#8217;Day kept
himself sober and his eyes and ears open to
all that was said and done in his place of
business. Finally, when his confidence was
fully restored, he returned to his old way
of doing business, and kept open one Sunday.
His place was filled with drunken,
riotous Poles and Slavs. In a spirit of
recklessness, he sold freely to all. On the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
following morning a summons was served
to appear before the court to answer to the
charge of illegal liquor selling. The charge
was brought by the Pole, big Joe Ratowsky.
Even then O&#8217;Day&#8217;s perception was dull.
It did not come to him that Joe was merely
the instrument in the hand of someone who
would not act openly.</p>
<p>Raffelo Bruno, the little hunchback shoemaker,
opened his eyes to the truth. He
was by nature suspicious. He had faith in
no man. When the summons came to
O&#8217;Day, Raffelo quit his bench and made his
way to the saloon. His dark, swarthy face,
with stubby beard, was twisted and contorted.
He gesticulated continuously, sawing
the air with his hands. &#8220;Ye-s&mdash;Joe
Ratowsky, he run and tell ze&mdash;ze. He
ees&mdash;one&mdash;fool. He ze monkee on ze stick.
Mees-ter Ho-bart, he meek hims&mdash;jump.&#8221;</p>
<p>The suggestion was enough. Joe was the
tool of someone, and that someone was
Superintendent Hobart; such was the idea
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
the Italian meant to convey. O&#8217;Day in forcible
terms cursed himself that he had not
seen this before. It was evident enough
now. Mr. Hobart, as superintendent, dare
not antagonize the drink-indulging miners
with open warfare against the saloon. Joe
was his tool, carrying out his plans. Joe
Ratowsky with his smattering of English
did not know enough to make himself a
formidable enemy. Some keen mind with
a knowledge of the liquor law was the power
back of the Pole. The coffee-house and
reading-room which Joe had opened were
mere subterfuges to draw the men away
from the saloon. The man could not and
did not make enough to keep himself and
family in the poor way they lived.</p>
<p>It was clear enough to O&#8217;Day now,
though he ridiculed Bruno for suggesting
that Mr. Hobart interested himself in such
matters.</p>
<p>The summons was served in October.
O&#8217;Day appeared before the November court.
They might have brought half a dozen different
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
counts against him, but they did not.
The prosecuting attorney, with great confidence
in his own judgment, had drawn up
the papers specifically charging Dennis
O&#8217;Day with selling to minors. He had evidence
sufficient on that one count to have
his license revoked.</p>
<p>The trial passed off quickly. Four boys,
not over sixteen, testified that Dennis O&#8217;Day
himself had sold liquor to them, not once
but many times. It was proof positive
without Joe Ratowsky giving his testimony.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Day himself sat hunched up in the prisoners&#8217;
dock, glinting his keen eyes about
from witness to juror. When the witnesses
had testified against him, his attorney
brought forth, in turn, the father of each
boy, who declared that he had personally
given the saloonist permission to sell liquor
to his son. By this the Minor Liquor Law
was, in effect, circumvented. That each
father was the richer by some of O&#8217;Day&#8217;s
money was generally supposed. But that
was not the issue at hand. The case was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
dismissed. O&#8217;Day went back to Bitumen
wiser in that he knew whom to fear, and
with the privilege of freely selling to the
young boys who had testified against him.</p>
<p>Though to all appearances the matter
ended here, the fight had just begun.</p>
<p>It would have been impossible for anyone,
except O&#8217;Day, to tell just how the
trouble began. But before a month had
passed, there arose a feeling of dissatisfaction
among the miners. It could be felt
rather than expressed. Where once every
Slav and Pole smiled at the mention of the
boss&#8217;s name, now there was only silence, a
silence ominous to those who knew the signs.
Joe Ratowsky understood and went at midnight
to ask Mr. Hobart to go away somewhere
for a time, until the discontent
passed. But Mr. Hobart was not one to
leave his work because a man of Dennis
O&#8217;Day&#8217;s stamp saw fit to disapprove of him.
If there was trouble brewing, there was all
the more reason for him to stand at his post.
He laughed at Ratowsky&#8217;s fears, and encouraged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
him to think that half the discontent
among the men was of his own imagination.</p>
<p>A series of accidents, or what passed as
such, began immediately after Dennis
O&#8217;Day was acquitted.</p>
<p>The cable, which drew the coal cars up
the incline, broke, letting them fall back at
break-neck speed against the engine-house.
Fortunately it occurred at a time when the
men were not riding up the incline, so no
lives were lost. This accident was the subject
of discussion that night at &#8220;The Miner&#8217;s
Rest.&#8221; O&#8217;Day was over-solicitous
about the welfare of the men. He criticised
corporations which risked the lives of the
workmen for the sake of saving. &#8220;Anyone
could see the cable was weak in spots,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t a week ago that I walked
up the incline&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t trust myself to
such a rotten chain. A new cable costs, of
course, and the company used the old one
till it fell to pieces. They hain&#8217;t risking
their lives. What does it matter to them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
if a few Slavs and Polacks hand in their
checks? Huns and Dagos are thick as
blackberries in June, and about as valuable.&#8221;</p>
<p>At his words the men about the tables
scowled. It mattered to them if a few lives
were lost, providing their own were among
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I had the corporations by the
throat,&#8221; added O&#8217;Day vehemently, all the
while watching the effect of his words upon
his hearers. He could read these people
like an open book, and he was keen enough
to know when it was wise to stop talking
and when continue. &#8220;I&#8217;d choke them into
taking care of the men&#8217;s lives. You&#8217;re all
just so many cattle to them. A Hun isn&#8217;t
so much to them as a cow, and they would
see you all in perdition rather than lose a
good mule.&#8221;</p>
<p>The faces about him were scowling and
malignant. Each man was ready to believe
all evil against that great and incomprehensible
body known as a corporation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
They had heard the war-cry between capital
and labor dinned into their ears since
the day they set foot upon American soil.
It meant nothing to them that their teachers
were always men like O&#8217;Day, who, while
lining their own pockets with the laborers&#8217;
earnings, cry out against the men who are
getting more, though lawfully. It never
came to their untrained minds that O&#8217;Day
proved nothing. He said so, that was
enough. O&#8217;Day listened to the muttered
growls of dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, I suppose,&#8221; he continued hypocritically,
&#8220;that we shouldn&#8217;t blame the men
who have put their money in the mines.
They are only wanting a fair interest on
their investment. That&#8217;s only right. No
doubt they send money enough right into
Bitumen to have things kept up first-class,
better houses for the miners, and cables that
don&#8217;t break. I&#8217;m thinking there hain&#8217;t one
of those big ones in the city who knows how
poor you men live, how little you get, and
how you risk your lives every day you work.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
How should they know? They spend
money enough to have things fine.&#8221; Then
he added, &#8220;They hain&#8217;t to blame if the
men they&#8217;ve put in charge hain&#8217;t honest.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was enough for one night. O&#8217;Day,
still discreet and tactful, dropped the subject.
Not so with the men. They rolled
the idea about until it grew into immense
proportions. A week passed, and yet they
talked. If there had been one among them
fitted to lead, there would have been open
trouble. There was no one. Bruno had
daring and sagacity enough, but he was an
Italian&mdash;a Dago, in common parlance, and
the Slavs and Poles hated the Dagos worse
than they hated the smallpox.</p>
<p>Sometime later a small stationary engine
blew up; and Colowski was hit on the head
by a piece of flying iron. Ellis, the engineer,
insisted that he was not careless. He
had kept his steam-register down to one
hundred and fifty pounds when the limit
was three hundred. Superintendent Hobart
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
was about to discharge him when Joe
Ratowsky appeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the tivil&#8217;s own work, b&#8217;gosh, Meester
Hobart. Gerani, he comes and he fools
with the little boiler-clock. Me come like
the tivil, b&#8217;gosh, or me could have stopped it
quick.&#8221; He had picked up the steam-register
and was holding it in his hand. It was
what he called the boiler-clock. It had been
hurled a great distance but yet remained
whole.</p>
<p>Mr. Hobart took it from Joe&#8217;s hand to
examine it. He had given little credence
to Ratowsky&#8217;s words. He whistled softly
to himself as he examined the register. He
began to believe the Pole right. Affairs
at Bitumen were assuming a serious aspect.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Day&#8217;s acquittal had taught him one lesson&mdash;to
be prepared for any emergency.
For that reason, he handed the register to
Ellis. &#8220;Look closely at that,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;There&#8217;s evidence enough there to free you
from blame. But I wish you and Joe to see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
this for yourselves and not take my word
for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellis, too, whistled when he examined the
register. Little wonder that he had not
been able to put on a full head of steam. A
strong but almost invisible steel rod had
been driven in the face of the register at
such a point that the hand moving under the
pressure of steam would stop at the one-hundred-and-fifty-pound
mark.</p>
<p>&#8220;It couldn&#8217;t have been driven there by
the explosion?&#8221; asked Ellis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible. We haven&#8217;t a steel brad
like that about the place, and never have
had. Joe saw Gerani prowling about before
you came.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I saw him leave, Mr. Hobart. I
went up to Bruno&#8217;s shack to have my shoes
fixed, and I came down over the hill instead
of the usual way by the road. Gerani was
just going up as I came down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Hobart made no further comment.
But from that time Gerani was watched
closely. Joe Ratowsky, while seemingly doing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
nothing but attend his little lunch-counter,
shadowed the man. He knew when
Gerani came and went. There was proof
enough that he had been interfering with
the engine. But it was not he alone whom
Mr. Hobart wished to reach. It was the
man back of the act who had sent the Pole
to do the work.</p>
<p>The superintendent thought at first of dismissing
Gerani. But this might bring on
more serious complications. His fellow-workmen
might object&mdash;the Huns and
Poles, at least. The Italians were not in the
mines but were employed about the dumps,
and on the road which wound about the
mountain. It was Joe again who thought
of a means of subduing Gerani. He had
heard enough of O&#8217;Day&#8217;s covert suggestion
that he could tell much that Gerani dreaded.
Joe undertook the same stratagem. One
stormy night he met Gerani on his way
home. Catching him by his sleeve, he detained
him long enough to say in his native
tongue, &#8220;I&#8217;ve a word to say to you in secret,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
brother. O&#8217;Day is not the only one that
knows about the Dago. The superintendent,
he knows, too; but he keeps quiet because
you are a good miner when you are
not drunk, brother. So a word of warning.
Keep friends with Mr. Hobart, and whatever
happens, don&#8217;t let it come to his ears
that Gerani went up at daylight to work at
the engine. Just a word of warning,
brother, all given in good faith, and for the
sake of the land from which we came.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was all. Joe Ratowsky strode on
through the darkness without giving the
other time to respond. In his own tongue,
his speech was impressive. He saw now,
from the frightened expression of Gerani&#8217;s
face, that his words had struck home.</p>
<p>The next morning, the big Pole was not at
the mines, nor did he come to draw the pay
due him. Joe Ratowsky chuckled to himself
when several days passed. &#8220;Gerani&mdash;oh&mdash;he
all right. We no fear him. Me
scare him like the tivil, b&#8217;gosh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Hobart rested easy again with Gerani
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
at a distance and afraid of him. But men
of O&#8217;Day&#8217;s stamp can readily find tools to
their need.</p>
<p>There was a week or more of quiet, then
the engine and one car, which went down the
mountain each morning to bring back the
mail, was derailed at the second switchback
and crashed into a forest of big oaks. The
car was empty, and the train, being on the
second switch, was moving backward. The
rear end of the coach was crushed but the
engine and engineer escaped unhurt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gerani,&#8221; said Mr. Hobart when he
heard the news, but Ratowsky shook his
head in negation. &#8220;You no see him no
more. He be bad man at Bitumen no more,
b&#8217;gosh.&#8221; Then Joe laughed heartily and
slapped his broad limbs with his hand. He
never lost his first appreciation of the manner
in which he had settled Gerani&#8217;s interference.
There had been a gang of a dozen
Italians somewhere along the road, but they
had neither seen nor heard anyone.</p>
<p>For several weeks communication between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
Bitumen and the rest of the world
was cut off. It was then that Joe Ratowsky
walked to the foot of the hill to telegraph
Elizabeth to remain at Exeter. And the
day following he called upon her, with a
letter, putting the best construction he could
upon the road being disabled.</p>
<p>There was a little mule-driver in the mines
who bore the euphonious name of Ketchomunoski.
He ate much wienerwurst and
drank beer freely, and on holidays devoured,
at one sitting, a half-dozen loaves of
bread, the centers of which had been previously
dug out and filled with melted lard.
He visited &#8220;The Miners&#8217; Rest&#8221; and reeled
home to his shack at a late hour. All these
are mere preliminary details to the statement
that his nerves were growing irritable,
and his temper uncertain. He beat one
mule until it was forced to return disabled
to the barn, and a few days later mistreated
a second until it was worthless and the boss
in a humane spirit had the animal shot.</p>
<p>For such cases a precedent had long been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
established. The boy deserved to be discharged
at once, and discharged he was.
Had conditions been normal, discharging a
mule-driver would have been of so little moment
it would have passed without comment.
But O&#8217;Day&#8217;s quiet work had not been without
its effect.</p>
<p>The same evening, a delegation of miners
waited upon Mr. Hobart. Ketchomunoski
was to be put back or the rest of them would
go out. Mr. Hobart listened to their terms.
He considered the question before replying.
Again he felt certain that another brain had
put the plan in operation. After deliberation,
he spoke to them plainly. Such a
movement on their part was ill-advised.
First, the largest orders for the year had
already been filled, and enough coal was at
the dumps and in cars at the foot of the
mountain to fill the orders which came in
month by month. So far as The Kettle
Creek Mining Company and its patrons
were concerned, the mines could shut down
until spring; as to the miners, they knew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
that they had neither money nor food to
supply them for a month.</p>
<p>He tried to reason with them; but the
Hungarians and Polack miners know no
reason. Mr. Hobart&#8217;s present method of
talking with them, to their way of thinking,
betokened not sound common sense and
judgment, but fear.</p>
<p>They blustered and threatened and defied.
At this, Mr. Hobart arose, declaring that
they might take what course they would, he
could <i>not</i> return Ketchomunoski to work.
The delegation, expressing their anger in
strong words, departed. Mr. Hobart immediately
sent word to Ratowsky, Ellis and
half a dozen other men whom he knew
would stand by him. Together they talked
over the situation, cleaned their firearms,
and then sent Ratowsky, by moonlight,
down the mountain to purchase and bring
back a supply of ammunition.</p>
<p>By the following evening the strike at Bitumen
was on.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h3>THE PROUD, HUMBLED.</h3>
</div>

<p>After the midwinter holidays, the question
of conducting examinations came up.
Dr. Kitchell had decided that, in view of
Miss Hobart&#8217;s refusing to take the examination,
she could not enter his classes again
until she had explained matters to Dr. Morgan
and secured permission from her. Elizabeth
dreaded talking matters over with Dr.
Morgan no more than with her father.
Upon her return to Exeter, she immediately
visited the president&#8217;s office, and explained
why she had refused to take the examination.
Dr. Morgan was in a lenient frame
of mind. She not only forgave Elizabeth
her hasty act, but took time to explain to
her that this was a custom old as examinations
themselves, and a necessity. The explanation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
satisfied Elizabeth&#8217;s wounded
feelings but did not alter her view of the
method. She told Dr. Morgan of the conference
the girls had held in her room the
night before the holidays and of the plan
they had formed which, with the permission
of the principal, they meant to carry out.</p>
<p>Dr. Morgan listened to the plan as Elizabeth
gave it in detail, then replied: &#8220;This
much can be said of the plan, Miss Hobart.
If it proves a success, it will be a benefit to
the students and the school. If it fails, we
are just where we were before&mdash;nothing
gained or lost. You may try it. But just
a word of advice. Select as your leaders
girls in whom the others have confidence;
those who may be trusted to do right; however
unpleasant it may be. Young girls
may laugh at and seemingly admire a smart
bravado of manner and sly deceit, but when
it comes to being led, they want none of
these. A dozen trustworthy agents will be
worth more than a hundred who are not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such advice Miss Cresswell had given
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
Elizabeth the evening of the meeting. She
had already acted upon it according to her
best lights, though it was no easy matter to
decide whom to choose. She and her
friends worked slowly. They wished the
reformation to be the outcome of deliberate
thought, rather than of impetuous emotion.</p>
<p>Nora O&#8217;Day was one of its staunch supporters.
At every opportunity she advocated
the acceptance of the new school creed
which Elizabeth and Miss Cresswell had
drawn up. Considering the part which she
had played in the examinations the previous
spring, her present position was a difficult
one. She knew that her strenuous efforts
were looked upon by some with suspicion.
But she continued. She might have become
discouraged had she not known that Miss
Cresswell and Elizabeth both understood.</p>
<p>Since that night before the holidays when
she had told Elizabeth the cause of her social
ostracism, no mention had been made of
the subject. There had been no change in
Elizabeth&#8217;s manner toward her. Nora began
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
to believe that Elizabeth cared enough
for her to forgive. Her greatest proof of
love for Elizabeth was giving her the essays
and theses which had been her mother&#8217;s.
The memory of this mother was the only bit
of real sentiment that had ever come into
the girl&#8217;s life. She was fond of her father
for he had always been kind to her. As a
child, she had idolized him. But as she
grew old enough to learn what character
meant, the childish faith died. She could
not put the feeling into words. She was
scarcely conscious that her attitude toward
him had changed. But at Exeter she had
learned to blush at the way in which his
wealth had been gained. She spoke of him,
but never of his business. She looked upon
the simple gifts and loving letters which
Elizabeth received from home with a feeling
very much like envy.</p>
<p>Before the Easter holidays, Mrs. Hobart
sent Elizabeth a simple school suit of her
own making. Joe Ratowsky carried it
down to Exeter. So many accidents had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
occurred on the dinky-road that it had been
abandoned until spring. The mines were
closed; and the operators were making no
effort to open them.</p>
<p>Nora was in the room when Elizabeth
spread out her new frock on the bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at the button-holes!&#8221; Elizabeth exclaimed.
&#8220;Mother always did make beautiful
button-holes. And here,&#8221; seizing a
smaller bundle and unwrapping it, &#8220;if she
hasn&#8217;t embroidered me two lay-over collars
to go with it! Mother always seems to
know what I want.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was already before the mirror laying
the bits of embroidered linen in place to
see if they fitted.</p>
<p>Her companion stood by, looking on. She
had made no comment. Her expression was
not cheerful. Turning suddenly about,
Elizabeth saw the dubious look.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t like it?&#8221; she cried. Then, &#8220;I
suppose it does look very cheap beside
yours, but&mdash;&#8221; There was no complaint in
her tone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Cheap? I wasn&#8217;t thinking of that. I
was only wishing I had one made as that
was made, by someone who took the trouble
because they cared for me.&#8221; Her voice was
tearful. In a moment she might have been
crying, but she hurried to her own room.
Her new spring dress had come the day before.
She had spread it out on the couch to
show Elizabeth, and it still lay there. She
took it up in her hands, inspecting with
care every hook and bit of trimming. It
was beautifully made and of handsome material.
But Nora O&#8217;Day was not satisfied.
She missed more and more the mother she
had never known. She coveted the plain,
simple gown which loving hands had made
for her friend.</p>
<p>Elizabeth wasted no time in putting her
frock into use. Dressing immediately, she
went over to Landis&#8217; room to talk over the
plan of examinations. Landis had been
one of the last interviewed. She was not
what might be called a &#8220;charter member.&#8221;
Therefore, it was not surprising that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
had not shown a great amount of enthusiasm
when the matter was broached to her.
Playing second fiddle did not suit her ambitious
temperament. She had promised to
consider the matter.</p>
<p>That promise had been given a week previously.
Elizabeth, who decided most questions
upon the spur of the moment, thought
a week was sufficient. Upon entering Miss
Stoner&#8217;s room, she put the question at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Landis, what are you going to do
about joining us?&#8221;</p>
<p>Landis looked serious. She sat silent for
a few minutes, her gaze fixed upon a design
in the rug, as though she wished to consider
well before replying. At last she spoke and
her voice expressed self-confidence and authority.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know me well enough, Elizabeth, to
know that I&#8217;m always on the side of what is
right. I have thought the matter over and
have decided that it is worthy of success. I
do hope it will succeed. That, of course, depends
upon those who are backing it. Yet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
I can not put my name to it. Now,&#8221; with
a serious and most impressive air such as
Landis only could assume, &#8220;do not misunderstand
me. It is not that I do not approve
of your plan, think it needed and
all that, but there is a personal reason
why I feel that I cannot join the movement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&mdash;because you feel that you can
not live up to the requirements?&#8221; was the
brusque question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly. I fancy I do whatever I make
up my mind to do. I&#8217;m sure living up to
the requirements would be doing just as I
have always done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Landis looked serious. Her expression
was that of one who could tell much
if they would. Her habit of seeming to
weigh her words gave them undue value.
Her hearers expected her to express lofty
sentiments.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hesitated about speaking of the matter
to anyone. It is so easy to be misunderstood.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
I would not have anyone think me
a cad; but there are some among your signers
whom I object to. I wouldn&#8217;t care to
have my name appear there with that of
another girl whom I have in mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>To Elizabeth who blurted out everything,
and who was frank and out-spoken, there
was nothing more distasteful than insinuations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whom do you mean, Landis?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not necessary to say,&#8221; was the response.
&#8220;I mentioned the fact only to let
you understand that it was not the policy
to which I objected. As I said before, I am
on the side of right. I wish my influence
always to be for good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is necessary to tell. The girls
who signed that first petition to Dr. Morgan
are friends of mine. They are girls who
stand well in school, and they&#8217;re popular,
every one of them. You cannot make such
a statement and think that I&#8217;m going to let
it pass. I&#8217;m not. You&#8217;ve insinuated something
against either me or my friends, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
you must come straight out and say what
it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Min, who had been sitting by the window
mending a pair of old gloves for Landis,
gave a nervous giggle. Any little unpleasantness
was painful to her. She stopped
sewing to listen to the conversation between
the girls. Landis was not nonplussed,
whatever the circumstances. She was not
offended now by Elizabeth&#8217;s words, but was
surprised. She appeared shocked that Elizabeth
should be crude enough to show vehemence.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a little spitfire you are, Elizabeth!
When you&#8217;re a few years older you&#8217;ll learn
not to express yourself so strongly. As to
your knowing who the girl is to whom I object,
there is no reason for my keeping silent.
I have not mentioned her name because
I was considering her feelings and reputation.
But since you insist, I&#8217;ll tell you.
I must emphatically object to having my
name published over Exeter Hall with Nora
O&#8217;Day&#8217;s.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Elizabeth asked calmly enough
now, yet she was exceedingly annoyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why? What a question to ask! Surely
you know how dishonorably she acted last
spring! Someone must have told you. You
and Mary Wilson are such friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; someone told me, but it wasn&#8217;t
Mary Wilson. She doesn&#8217;t do that sort
of thing. Nora O&#8217;Day told me. Are
you afraid to join the same set with
her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not afraid in one sense of the word. To
be sure, she would not influence me an iota.
I might mingle with her and her kind and
be none the worse for it. Do not think I
am considering myself in the matter. I
have in mind the younger set of girls who
are so easily influenced. They know the
story of Miss O&#8217;Day&#8217;s methods in examination.
What would they think of seeing my
name in connection with hers?&mdash;that I
would countenance anything that was dishonorable!
If not that, at least, like me,
they might be suspicious of a reform that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
had among its leaders a girl who had been
publicly reprimanded for cheating.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the talk, Elizabeth had been leaning
backward against the study-table, her
hands behind her, supporting her weight.</p>
<p>She paused before replying to Landis.
Then she asked: &#8220;Do you believe in treating
every one who has done wrong as you
intend treating Nora?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely. To treat them otherwise would
be an open acknowledgment that we are
willing to overlook deceit and fraud. No
one can afford to do that. You must remember
the stand Dr. Morgan takes on such
matters. You have heard her lecture often
enough to know that she does not countenance
treating sin and crime lightly. Why,
in her last chapel-talk she said that while
some amusements might be legitimate and
proper for us, we must refrain from them
because of our influencing others who might
be harmed. I&#8217;m sure I could find no better
person to follow than Dr. Morgan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not think her words applied to this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
instance. At least I would not have taken
it so. Nora did cheat last spring; but perhaps
she is sorry for it. You do not know
but that she looks upon it now with more
scorn than you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so. I hope Exeter has had some
influence upon her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think, Landis, the proper
thing to do, when we know she is ashamed
of what she did last spring, is to help her
all we can? It seems so unforgiving to be
remembering always the little mean actions.
I think she has suffered enough as
it is. I don&#8217;t see what is to be gained by
slighting her now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you don&#8217;t; but this is your first
year at Exeter and you have lots more to
learn. When you have been here two years
more, perhaps your ethical standard will be
higher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Until I am capable of <i>copying</i> other
people&#8217;s essays and passing them off for
my own.&#8221; Elizabeth&#8217;s lips had grown white
as Landis spoke. Never before in all her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
life had she been as angry as now. It was
not alone Landis&#8217; words which hurt her, but
the girl&#8217;s manner and tone, which were most
insulting.</p>
<p>For an instant Landis&#8217; face grew crimson.
Elizabeth&#8217;s remark had struck home. Her
embarrassment lasted only for a moment.
She was her cool, confident self again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll never be capable of that,&#8221;
was the rejoinder, spoken lightly as she
moved to her desk and took up a pencil preparatory
to writing. &#8220;Exeter is scarcely a
place where one learns such methods. One
must have brought the disposition for such
things with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth was not deceived by the light
tone of the remark. Having entered into
the discussion, she did not intend to retreat
with lowered flag. However, it was scarcely
fair to Landis to put her at a disadvantage
in Min Kean&#8217;s presence. While Landis was
speaking, the situation presented itself
clearly to Elizabeth&#8217;s mind. She turned to
Miss Kean.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Min, would you care to go over to call on
my roommate for a few minutes? You&#8217;ll
find some home-made candy which mother
sent with Joe Ratowsky. I wish to speak
with Landis, and it&#8217;s really too personal for
even you to hear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, certainly! I&#8217;ll take the gloves
along and finish my mending there. But
don&#8217;t quarrel while I&#8217;m gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scarcely,&#8221; was the reply from Landis.
&#8220;I never have quarreled with anyone and I
have no desire to begin now.&#8221; She was
much taller than before. She was really
quite an impressive person when she was on
her dignity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she asked, turning to Elizabeth
as the door closed after Min. Her manner
and facial expression added, &#8220;If you have
anything to say, you little insignificant
member of the Middlers, say it. Such an
august personage as myself has no time to
waste in conversation with a little girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth did not falter. &#8220;I did not wish
Min to hear what I have to say. She looks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
up to you as the literary light at Exeter, and
I see no reason to undeceive her. I&#8217;ve
known these little facts I&#8217;m about to mention
since last holidays; but I&#8217;ve told no one.
I would never have brought up the subject
for discussion, even with you, if you had not
been so bitter against Nora. It seems so
perfectly ridiculous for you to criticise her
for cheating once in examination when
you&#8217;ve kept up the same system for
months.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will soon if you do not now. As I
have already said, I would have kept this to
myself had you not been insulting to me ever
since I came in this morning. I won&#8217;t be
patronized by anyone that I have no confidence
in. Every one at Exeter praises your
fine essays. I used to, but I don&#8217;t any
more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter with you this morning,
Elizabeth? I insulting to you! The
idea was farthest from my thoughts. I&#8217;m
nervous. I suppose that accounts for my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
speaking so you misunderstood me. I&#8217;m
really working very hard. I&#8217;m anxious to
make a creditable passing mark, and then
I have Min to coach. You know she does
not grasp lessons so quickly as you and some
of the brighter ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the open flattery did not lead Elizabeth
away from the subject. She had grown
years wiser in the six months spent at Exeter.
Her knowledge had cost her much of
her girlish confidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;&#8221; she began.</p>
<p>Landis, determined to ignore unpleasant
subjects, interrupted with, &#8220;Have you ever
been out to the Adams&#8217; farm? I suppose
you haven&#8217;t, since this is your first spring
at Exeter. There&#8217;s a big woods near the
house. It is filled with arbutus. I suppose
it is beginning to leaf now. Min
and I go out every spring to spend a day
and night. We come home laden with arbutus.
We&#8217;re going again a week from this
coming Saturday. I wish you and Mary
Wilson would go along. We get a livery
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
rig and drive out. Can&#8217;t you go with us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It shall not cost you a cent. Min and I
will pay the livery bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I think I could manage to pay my
share,&#8221; dryly. &#8220;It was not that which
made me refuse to accept. I feel in this as
you do about Nora O&#8217;Day. I wish to tell
you about what I learned last holidays.&#8221;
She talked hurriedly, allowing Landis no
opportunity to interrupt. &#8220;Nora O&#8217;Day by
chance mentioned that you came to see her
and read some of her mother&#8217;s theses.
Nora did not suspect you. She thought you
were inclined to be literary, and felt pleased
that you approved of the work her mother
did years ago. That is all she thought
about it. I did more thinking while Nora
was telling me. I thought that Landis
Stoner must be a little mite deceitful or she
would not be critical of Nora when others
were present and yet slip in to see her during
study-hours. It seemed&mdash;well&mdash;it
seemed downright deceitful to me.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I heard you deliver an oration in the
chapel. You know that you speak well, and
so you are in every public affair. At least,
you have been ever since I&#8217;ve been at Exeter.
Your orations have been fine. I
thought you were wonderfully bright until
the Christmas holidays. When I was leaving,
Nora brought me some of her mother&#8217;s
essays to read. I read them while I was at
Windburne.&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused and looked straight at Landis.
Landis had no words to reply. She stood,
dignified and erect by the study-table, toying
with a silver paper-knife. The silence
lasted for some minutes. Then feeling that
Elizabeth was waiting for some word she
gave a non-committal, &#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it isn&#8217;t &#8216;well.&#8217; It is anything but
&#8216;well&#8217;. It&#8217;s what I call decidedly bad. The
instant I read those essays, I discovered
that your work was cribbed. You had
read&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a fuss you make about nothing at
all, Elizabeth! To hear you talk, one might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
think that I was guilty of wholesale robbery,
or murder, or some other horrible
crime. You young girls who are new to
school-life and have had no experience outside
your own little town do not understand
these matters. You are, if I may say it, a
little narrow in your views. You know
only one way, and have the notion that there
can be no other. You say I read those essays.
Why, of course I did. They were
good, too, and I received a great deal of
help from them. Every one who writes
even a little bit makes an effort to read all
the good things along the same lines. That
is the only way one can develop talent. I
got some excellent ideas from Mrs. O&#8217;Day&#8217;s
essays. Is there anything criminal in
that? If there is, then we must lock up
our histories and reference books when
we have any article to prepare for classwork.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it were receiving ideas merely, I
should scarcely mention the matter to you;
or even had you taken the ideas wholesale
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
and expressed them in your own words, I
should have said nothing at all. But you
did not do that. Landis, you know you did
not, and you cannot convince me by a few
fine words that you did. The oration you
delivered in chapel, the last rhetorical before
the holidays, is almost word for word
like the original. You gave me your copy
to write up for our society paper. I have
it, and also the original. If you are still
doubtful of my statement, I&#8217;ll go with you
to Dr. Morgan and give them to her to
read.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I believe you,&#8221; was the reply given
in an indifferent manner. &#8220;That was the
one &#8216;Character Sketches in Shakespeare.&#8217;
I had forgotten about that. We were
rushed with work. I remember now. I
had no time to write an oration suitable for
a public affair. I remember I did commit
one of those old ones. But I do not think I
claimed it was original. You people just
took that for granted. If you had taken
the trouble to ask me, I would have told you.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
I do not know that it is my fault that you
were deceived.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Landis,&#8221; said Elizabeth slowly,
&#8220;you are surely an adept in slipping out of
trouble. Now, Nora O&#8217;Day did wrong and
made no attempt to deny it. She bore her
punishment without a complaint. Your
words do not deceive me one iota. They
would have done so six months ago. But
that time&#8217;s gone. It really does me good to
speak so plainly to you now. I have felt
deceitful all along in knowing about those
papers, and then listening quietly while you
criticized every one else at Exeter&mdash;girls
who would not be guilty of doing what you
have done. We will not discuss the subject
further, but do not think that you are deceiving
me. You are not. You copied, not
one, but most of your orations and theses.
But do not worry. Continue to copy if you
wish. It is none of my affairs, and I shall
tell no one. Now I&#8217;m through talking with
you, and I feel a great deal better for telling
you what I know.&#8221; Turning, she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
walked toward the door. &#8220;I&#8217;m going back
to my room to get to work now. I&#8217;ll tell
Min that she can come back if she wishes
to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Elizabeth, you came to talk about
the method of examinations,&#8221; said Landis
sweetly. She did not lift her eyes to meet
the direct glance of her caller. She still
continued to play with the paper-knife, running
it up and down the felt of the table,
making depressions in geometrical designs.
&#8220;Since you feel as you do about Nora
O&#8217;Day, that she is sorry and all that, and
since she is a friend of yours, I&#8217;ll withdraw
my objections to her. Of course, I feel as
you do. It is not right to judge anyone.
I&#8217;ll not remember her past deeds against
her. Bring along your paper when you go
into class, and I&#8217;ll put down my name, and
I&#8217;ll promise for Min, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth wheeled suddenly about. &#8220;I do
not wish you to sign it. We shall manage
the affair very well without you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as you please.&#8221; Here Landis&#8217; self-confidence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
forsook her. She could not believe
it possible that any girl would be generous
enough to keep to herself such a matter
as that of the essay-copying. Should
Elizabeth tell but one or two, the affair
would soon become public property. Her
name would be mentioned with scorn
throughout Exeter. Already she saw herself
ostracized as she had helped to ostracize
Nora O&#8217;Day. But if such a condition
would result from her dishonesty, she would
leave The Hall at once. She was much too
proud, too ambitious, to allow anyone to ignore
her. She stepped toward Elizabeth,
holding out her hands appealingly. &#8220;Elizabeth
Hobart, don&#8217;t, I beg of you, let anyone
else know of this. Promise me you will
tell no one and I&#8217;ll do whatever you ask
me to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All I ask of you is to let my friends go
free of your criticism. You lead a certain
set. Whatever you do, they will also do. I
wish you to make them drop that old, worn-out
subject of Nora O&#8217;Day&#8217;s cheating.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I will&mdash;I promise you that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You and Min need not sign our petition
to Dr. Morgan or the pledge we send in.
They are to be ready before to-morrow&mdash;but
you are to give me your promise to live
up to the requirements.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do that. I have never taken advantage
in examinations. They have always
been easy enough without that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth knew this to be quite true.
Landis was one of the strongest members of
the Senior class and she worked hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we understand each other,&#8221; said
Elizabeth. &#8220;From this time on, we&#8217;ll be
just as before. No one need know we have
had this talk.&#8221; She passed into the hall at
these words, leaving Landis alone to reflect
upon their conversation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h3>THE SENIORS OUTWITTED.</h3>
</div>

<p>When the Seniors and the Middlers, at
the close of the spring semester, entered
the class-room to take their examination in
trigonometry, they found Dr. Kitchell the
only member of the faculty present. He
remained long enough to pass the small,
printed slips of questions, and to explain
the manner in which he wished the work
done. A smile of relief passed over the
class as he took his departure. Soon pencils
and rulers were busy. The sound of
their moving was all that was heard in the
class-room. No word was spoken. The
work continued for over an hour. Then
one member, having finished, arose and,
placing her papers on the table which stood
near the front, quitted the room. One by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
one, as they completed the examination, the
others followed her example.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was among the last to leave.
Her face was beaming with satisfaction at
the spirit in which her plan had been carried
out. In the main hall she met Dr.
Kitchell.</p>
<p>&#8220;The girls are all through,&#8221; she exclaimed,
a thrill of pleasureable excitement
showing in her voice. &#8220;There was not a
word spoken, nor communication of any
sort.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is truly the only way to conduct an
examination,&#8221; he answered, turning to walk
with her down the hall to the dormitory.
&#8220;The credit should be given to you, Miss
Hobart. This police-duty, which so insulted
you last fall, was not pleasant work
for a teacher; but custom makes slaves of us
all. Nothing will please us better than
knowing that Exeter can have honest examinations
without faculty supervision.
We have wished for just such conditions as
this, but they seemed rather to be dreamed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
of than realized. An instructor can do little
in such matters. The desire must come
from the students. We give you, Miss Hobart,
the credit of this change.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know that I should have it,&#8221;
was the reply. &#8220;It is not that I was more
sensitive or had higher ideals than the other
girls. It was that they were accustomed to
such supervision since the days when they
entered school, while it was all new to me.
And being new, it impressed me greatly.
You see,&#8221; she added, looking up at Dr.
Kitchell as though she did not wish him to
misinterpret her leaving his class-room that
day of the first examination, &#8220;outside of
class, you would not have thought of such a
thing as questioning our word or our honesty,
yet by your way of conducting an examination,
you did both.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is true in part. I questioned the
honor of some. <i>Class honor</i>, I should say.
But there is yet another side to that. Students
who would scorn to be other than
strictly fair and upright outside of class
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
have stooped to all manner of subterfuge to
pass an examination. All sense of moral
responsibility evaporated the instant they
took that little slip of printed questions in
their hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I have learned,&#8221; said Elizabeth. She
could not refrain from smiling. Dr. Kitchell
had a jocular manner. His words, even
in the discussions of the most serious matters,
had a touch of humor. &#8220;That is what
surprised me most. The girls are Christians,
that is, the greater number are. But
one would have thought it was a reform
school. I think those days are gone. Every
Senior and Middler is pledged to conduct
examinations as they were conducted this
morning, and we are heartily glad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So say we all of us,&#8221; was the cordial response.</p>
<p>They had come to the hall leading to the
girls&#8217; dormitory. So far and no farther
could Dr. Kitchell walk with Miss Hobart.
Elizabeth hurried to her room. Loud tones
came from her apartment. Opening the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
door quietly, she peered in as though half
afraid of what she might encounter. Mary
Wilson was pacing up and down the room.
Her head was high. Her chest was expanded.
A glow of rhetorical enthusiasm
was upon her cheeks and in her eye. In
one hand, she held several sheets of typewritten
paper toward which at intervals her
glance wandered. The other hand sawed
the air in impressive, if not graceful, gesticulations.</p>
<p>She heeded not the entrance of her roommate.
She continued orating in tones which
she was striving to make full and round.
She gave a hurried glance at her paper,
strode up the room, flung out her hand and
roared forth, &#8220;I&#8217;m <i>charged</i> with pride and
ambition&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did they <i>charge</i> you for it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The charge is true&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, Mary, all I can advise is to
pay the bill and not say anything more
about it. If you haven&#8217;t change enough, I
can lend&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And I <i>glory in its truth</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sinking back in her chair as though this
was too much to be borne, Elizabeth sighed
deeply, then said, &#8220;I&#8217;m surely surprised at
you, Mary. Affairs have come to a pretty
pass when you&#8217;re in debt and take glory
in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary laughed, tossed aside her paper, and
coming over to her roommate, sat down beside
her. &#8220;It&#8217;s my new oration. Miss
Brosius called me into her office, and gave
me this to learn. It is really very fine&mdash;effective,
if my voice was not quite so high-pitched.
Listen, I&#8217;ve learned so much already.&#8221;
She tossed back her locks and assumed
a rostrum manner, &#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m charged
with pride and ambition. The charge is
true and I glory in its truth. Whoever
achieved anything great in letters, art or
arms who was not ambitious? Cæsar was
not more ambitious than Cicero, it was only
in another way.&#8217; That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve learned.
Miss Brosius went over so much with me
that I would get into the spirit of the piece.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
I wish you might hear her read it! She&#8217;s
such a dainty little creature, but she looked
tall when she was rolling this out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it for? You&#8217;ve had all your
oratory work long ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is especially for commencement.
You see, we don&#8217;t have the old-style exercises.
The Dean from some other school
or some eminent divine comes to deliver a
lecture. There&#8217;s music wherever there&#8217;s a
loophole to slip it in. Then the class in cap
and gown parade across the stage and receive
their diplomas from Dr. Morgan. Oh,
it&#8217;s all very fine and elegant and all that.
But there&#8217;s no fun in it. The element of
humor is lacking, and after an hour of it,
the simple dignity of it palls on one. And
as for the dresses! Most of the girls wear
simple white shirtwaist suits under their
gowns. There are receptions, to be sure;
but the Middlers and Freshmen attend them,
and dress as much as the Seniors do. The
only opportunity a Senior has to trail a long
gown after her is on Class-day. Then we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
have all the old orthodox orations and music
with a two-act farce thrown in, and we may
wear what we please. And let me announce
right here, Elizabeth Hobart, your roommate
will appear in the handsomest white
evening dress she can get&mdash;train, short
sleeves, high-heeled shoes, and hair piled on
top of my head.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked at the short locks, barely
touching the speaker&#8217;s shoulders. She
laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You think it can&#8217;t be done!&#8221; exclaimed
Mary, with the characteristic toss of her
head. &#8220;But it can. I&#8217;m going to have a
hairdresser. Yes, indeed. When I assume
the role, I mean to carry it out. Wait until
you see Mrs. Jones. She can take two hairs
and twist them about until they look like
nothing else so much as Paderewski. She
has fine switches, too.&#8221; This was added after
a moment&#8217;s thought, and confidentially,
as though it was not information to be
passed around. Then with a sigh of satisfaction,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
&#8220;One can work wonders with
switches.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not to mention to anyone what
I am to do for Class-day. Those matters
are supposed to be secrets. Of course, you
could not help knowing, for I must practice
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the days following, it was made plain
that Elizabeth could not have been kept
from the knowledge of what Mary was doing.
From morning until evening, at all
times, opportune and otherwise, Mary orated.
When her throat grew husky from
her efforts, she compared samples of white
tulle, and point d&#8217;esprit, and embroidered
mull. She insisted upon Elizabeth&#8217;s opinion
in regard to each one of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve learned one thing,&#8221; said Elizabeth.
&#8220;I never knew there were more than a hundred
varieties of white material. But&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are thousands of them. I&#8217;ve discovered
that this last few weeks. One thing
is gained. You do increase your vocabulary.
You must have different adjectives
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
to express your admiration of each kind.
What do you Middlers plan to do commencement
week?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked down her nose. She
could appear very innocent when she chose.
&#8220;There was some mention made of a banquet,&#8221;
she replied. &#8220;There was talk also
of having a caterer from town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess not!&#8221; exclaimed Mary,
arising. Her eyes were flashing with the
spirit of school warfare. &#8220;I think you Middlers
will think again about having anything
so fine. Never in the history of Exeter
have the Middlers given a banquet, and
they shall not now. We shall keep them
from it. We&#8217;ll treat you as the Seniors
treated us last year. We, too, had a notion
that we would give a banquet. We were so
confident that we telephoned our order to
the caterer; but we didn&#8217;t have the banquet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t he receive the order?&#8221; The
question was asked in such an innocent,
seeking-for-information manner that Mary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
ought to have been suspicious, but she was
not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, he received the order and the
money to pay for it. We waited in the
gym, all togged out in reception gowns, but
the caterer came not. Suddenly it came to
us that there must be some mistake. We
set out to hunt for the banquet. We found
its remains up in the laboratory where the
Seniors had been feasting at our expense.
No, indeed, Elizabeth,&#8221; Mary shook her
head slowly, &#8220;no Middlers hold banquets
at Exeter Hall. It isn&#8217;t countenanced.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We may try it, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you will. I should like to feast
my friends at the Middlers&#8217; expense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth brought up the subject of the
banquet again and again. Apparently inadvertently,
she let drop many little points
about the affair which were eagerly seized
upon by her roommate. Mary was surprised
at Elizabeth&#8217;s want of discretion.
She seemed prone to let many a class secret
escape.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span></p>
<p>It was evident the Middlers were laying
plans for something. In groups of two and
three, they surreptitiously visited each
other. They gathered in hallways for whispered
conferences. The Seniors were not
blind. Each had her appointed work, and
when the Middlers gathered together, there
was a Senior concealed near by, with ears
and eyes open. If the Middlers suspected
that they were being shadowed, they made
no signs.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a banquet, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; confided
Mary Wilson to Landis and Min. &#8220;We
have our class exercises on Tuesday evening.
The time was set for then, but Elizabeth
Hobart and some of the others had that
changed. They wish to attend our exercises.
So it will be Wednesday evening.
Elizabeth was writing when I went into the
room. Like a flash, she covered the letter;
but I saw enough to help us out. The letter
was addressed to Achenbach. I saw the
word &#8216;Wednesday.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That settles it; for Nancy Eckdahl was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
making out a menu in chapel yesterday, and
the Middlers who take water-colors are
painting place-cards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What had best be done? I&#8217;d like to
have them send on the banquet and lead
the delivery men off somewhere else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Mary, that will not be possible.
Most of the Middlers know what happened
last year. They&#8217;ll keep a watch on us, and
if they are wise, they&#8217;ll send out scouts to
meet the caterer at the train,&#8221; said Mame
Welch.</p>
<p>&#8220;They shall not banquet if we take it
from them by force!&#8221; Then suddenly her
face lighted up. &#8220;I have it. Landis, you
must do this part. You have such a don&#8217;t-interfere-with-me
manner that Achenbach
will do exactly as you wish. Get permission
to go into town. Go to Achenbach&#8217;s
and tell them that the Seniors have discovered
where the banquet is to be served, that
you have come to give new orders, as the
Seniors are determined to appropriate the
banquet for themselves.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span></p>
<p>There were a dozen Seniors in the room.
They all gave their approval to Miss Wilson&#8217;s
plan. Then they discussed it in detail.
The laundry, big and bare, would be an unsuspected
place. There were ironing boards
and folding tables that would do to serve
on.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if they are not enough,&#8221; exclaimed
Mary Wilson, &#8220;there&#8217;s the floor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Landis received her instructions. She
was to go into the city the following morning
and visit Achenbach, the caterer. She
was to be as self-confident as possible. He
might have been instructed not to tell anyone
where and when his services were ordered.
Landis was not to be led off by his
assumed ignorance. She was to tell him
plainly that she referred to the order sent
in by Miss Hobart the day before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just raise your head high and look
straight at him,&#8221; advised Mary Wilson.
&#8220;Scare him into it, Landis.&#8221;</p>
<p>The following morning, according to plan,
Landis, dressed in the trimmest of tailor-made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
gowns, went to the city. She visited
Achenbach&#8217;s and did as the girls had directed.
As had been expected, the clerk
pleaded ignorance of such orders as she
mentioned. Landis insisted. The clerk
then called the proprietor to verify him. If
the order had been received, both proprietor
and attendant acted their parts well.
Landis could obtain no information from
them. Yet, to fulfill her errand, still suspecting
that they knew more than they
would tell, Landis, just as she was going,
left orders to have the banquet served in the
laundry. &#8220;You may think it rather an odd
place, Mr. Achenbach; but the Seniors stole
the banquet last year. They will do the
same now if the opportunity is given them.
They will do all they can to mislead the men
you send to serve. Pay no attention to orders
after this, but have your men go directly
to the laundry. They must go around
the back way, of course. One of the class
will be watching for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still Mr. Achenbach protested that there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
must be some misunderstanding. He had
received no orders from Exeter.</p>
<p>Landis went back to school at once, and
recounted her experiences to the girls.
Mary Wilson was confident that Elizabeth
had sent in the order. They would be on
their guard that particular evening, and permit
no caterer to enter the Hall unless under
their orders.</p>
<p>The Middlers had some plan afoot. If
not a banquet&mdash;what then? But the Seniors
were agreed it was that. Nancy&#8217;s
roommate had found a carefully-written
menu. And Landis had surprised another
Middler painting menu and place cards.
That it was to take place, was evident. But
where&mdash;when? The group of Seniors separated,
each admonishing the others to watch
the Middlers, and not permit them to talk
together alone.</p>
<p>Mary Wilson&#8217;s especial duty was to restrain
Elizabeth from holding communication
with the others. With true diplomacy,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
she kept her roommate busy so that she had
no time to visit other rooms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just hear me go over my oration once
more, Elizabeth, please,&#8221; she would say.
&#8220;I&#8217;m apt to get careless if I recite without
an audience. Sit over there by the window.
I&#8217;ll stand here. Now, don&#8217;t be afraid to
tell me if you think I might improve any
part.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Elizabeth would patiently sit and
listen. She showed great interest. She
followed closely every word. She lost no
gesture, no facial expression. &#8220;I think I
could repeat it word for word,&#8221; she said,
when Mary had practiced for the last time,
the morning of Class-day. &#8220;I could make
every gesture you do. I&#8217;m really looking
forward to this evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary&#8217;s face flushed with pleasure. &#8220;I&#8217;m
glad you like it. I hope it will pass off
well. You see, the chapel will be crowded.
The galleries are always filled; and, visitors
are glad to get standing room below. It&#8217;s
our best day, and I wish to do myself and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
the school credit.&#8221; Then suddenly remembering
that she was to find out what she
could of the Middlers&#8217; plans, she asked suddenly,
&#8220;Have you any engagement for to-morrow
evening, Elizabeth? What do you
say about getting up a tally-ho party, our
own set and a few visitors, and driving out
by moonlight?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth turned her head aside as though
she did not wish Mary to see her embarrassment.
She hesitated before replying. &#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;don&#8217;t
believe I can, Mary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any engagement?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&mdash;Oh, I don&#8217;t know what to say.
Please don&#8217;t ask me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary smiled to herself, then turned back
to the mirror for the better arrangement of
her hair. Her convictions were strengthened.
Whatever the Middlers had on hand,
to-morrow night was the time for the doings.
When to-morrow night came&mdash;! Mary
smiled at the thought. To-morrow
night would find every Middler followed by
a Senior.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span></p>
<p>The week had begun with the excitement
usually attendant upon commencement.
Relatives and friends began to appear on
Monday. The continuous flow of guests
taxed to the limit the accommodations of the
Hall. Bedrooms were doing double duty.
Meals were taken in relays. Every one
bore with exceedingly good humor the little
inconveniences incident to such an overflow.</p>
<p>Dr. Shull of the Irvington Female College
lectured to the class Tuesday morning.
This was followed by the presentation of diplomas.
The graduates in caps and gowns
marched through the chapel and across the
stage. So far as commencement proper
was concerned, this was their first and last
appearance.</p>
<p>&#8220;But wait until this evening, and the
Thursday night promenade! We&#8217;ll shine
then,&#8221; Mary Wilson had whispered confidentially
to her friends. &#8220;Every girl in the
class has done herself proud about her new
gowns&mdash;one for the prom and one for to-night,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
not to mention a few extras for the
tree-planting and the rose parade.&#8221;</p>
<p>The eventful evening came at last. Mrs.
Jones bearing extra switches and fancy
combs, her ebony face wreathed in smiles,
had already arrived, and stood waiting Miss
Wilson&#8217;s pleasure. The much-talked-of
dress of shimmering silk, over which point
d&#8217;esprit hung like a cloud, lay over the bed
ready for its wearer.</p>
<p>The girls were hurrying, as the time was
growing short. Elizabeth stood ready to
slip into the simple white frock which Joe
Ratowsky had brought from Bitumen a few
days before. She took up her dress and
then laid it down again, and turned to the
mirror pretending to put a stray lock in
place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry, you&#8217;ll have no time to waste,
Elizabeth. You must get in early if you
wish a seat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just then a knock came at the door.
Without waiting an invitation, Nancy
thrust her head in. She had not yet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
dressed; but was wearing a bright kimono,
her yellow hair streaming over her
shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary, hurry up to the chapel anteroom.
Oh, don&#8217;t wait to dress. There&#8217;s a change
in the program and every one who is to take
part must come at once. Hurry! They are
waiting for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Picking up the belt she had just discarded,
and fastening it as she walked,
Mary hurriedly quitted the room. The anteroom
was a small place fitted up like a
parlor, at the side of the stage and on a
level with it. A single pane of glass
fixed solidly in the wall gave the occupants
a view of the stage, yet they could not be
seen by the audience. It was here the
teacher of oratory sat during the performance.
At times, it served as a dressing-room.</p>
<p>The curtain was down. In order to save
time and steps, Mary ran across the stage,
between the scenery. At her hurried knock
a key was turned, and the door of the anteroom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
opened wide enough to allow her to
slip in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; the doorkeeper whispered, carefully
locking the door after admitting her.</p>
<p>Landis, Mame, Anna Cresswell and a
dozen others were already there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we all here now?&#8221; whispered the
doorkeeper. They began to count. The
light was so dim that they could barely distinguish
faces.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fourteen,&#8221; said Landis. &#8220;That is all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be sure,&#8221; admonished the keeper of the
keys in sepulchral tones. &#8220;I would not
for worlds have one absent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all.&#8221; &#8220;Fourteen.&#8221; &#8220;We&#8217;re all
here.&#8221; &#8220;Do tell us so that we can hurry
back to dress!&#8221; came from the members of
the group.</p>
<p>At this, the girl with the keys drew her
chair close to a second door leading into a
dark, unfinished attic. Over the door which
was nailed shut was a small transom. As
she mounted the chair, Mary Wilson for the
first time recognized her as a Miss Bowman,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
a special student in music, neither a Middler
nor a Senior.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Miss Bowman, lifting her
hand with the key in it to the open transom,
and turning to face the girls, &#8220;then we&#8217;ll
stay here.&#8221; With that she dropped the key
into the attic. They were prisoners; she,
with them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s those Middlers,&#8221; groaned Mary
Wilson. &#8220;We might have known; and my
little innocent Elizabeth is at the bottom of
this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Console yourselves,&#8221; advised Miss Bowman.
&#8220;When the curtain goes up, you will
have a fine view of the Senior exercises.
They will be well worth the price you&#8217;ve
paid for admission.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<h3>IMPRISONMENT.</h3>
</div>

<p>Elizabeth turned the key in the lock the
instant Mary stepped from the room. Then,
as quickly as possible, she got into her roommate&#8217;s
white gown. Mrs. Jones, with a
broad smile playing over her ebony features,
stood by with pins and ribbons.
From her mysterious boxes, that Mary supposed
contained the switches with which one
could do wonders, she brought forth a wig
of yellow-brown hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Pears like this &#8217;ud do. The other
young lady hab hair what just come to her
shoulders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is just fine,&#8221; exclaimed Elizabeth, &#8220;as
near the color of Miss Wilson&#8217;s as I can
hope for.&#8221; She studied herself in the mirror
as Mrs. Jones adjusted the wig. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
know every gesture that Mary makes except
this.&#8221; She gave her head a toss, shaking
back the fringe of hair about her shoulders.</p>
<p>She hurried dressing for it was almost
time for the curtain to rise. &#8220;There!&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;I&#8217;m ready. I hope the way is
clear for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hastening to the door, she peered into the
hall. Not a &#8216;noble Senior&#8217; was in sight.
The girls flitting through the dormitories
were Middlers and Freshmen. Confident
that she was safe from interference, Elizabeth,
her white gown trailing after her,
started forth for the chapel. Nancy Eckdahl
and Mame Welch joined her at the foot
of the stairway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t I look like a boiled lobster?&#8221; cried
Nancy. &#8220;But this was the only dress anywhere
near my size. It&#8217;s Nora O&#8217;Day&#8217;s.
Isn&#8217;t it handsome? It is unfortunate that
she is so dark and I so fair. But it was
this or nothing. Think of a yellow-haired
girl in an orange-colored gown.&#8221;</p>
<p>The effect was startling. Nora, with her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
dark eyes and coloring, would have looked
like a picture in this vivid orange; but
Nancy, with her blue eyes and flaxen hair,
looked anything but picturesque.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are comfortable,&#8221; gasped
Mame, in short breaths. &#8220;If Min Kean had
had a little more flesh on her bones when
this dress was fitted, I would have felt better
now. Nancy had to use a shoe-hook to
fasten the buttons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you seen Laura Downs? She
looks exactly like Landis. The dress fits
except it is a little short in the waist; but
Azzie pinned up the skirt. It doesn&#8217;t look
bad. She was in our room before she went
down. And she &#8216;did&#8217; Landis to perfection&mdash;that
same haughty manner that Landis
has when she means to impress one.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they moved along, their number increased.
The leading spirits of the Middler
class were there, each decked out in the
new gown that some Senior, whose manner
and tricks of speech she had been studying
for weeks to impersonate, would have worn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
had she not been locked up in the little
greenroom near the stage of the chapel.</p>
<p>There had been no Middler of sufficient
height and dignity to impersonate Dr. Morgan.
Yet she was a light of so great magnitude
that she could not be ignored. Miss
Hogue, a special student, a girl devoted to
the classics, and a writer for all the school
papers, had been pressed into service. Dr.
Morgan when she had appeared upon the
rostrum during the commencement exercises
had worn a gown of black lace, its sombre
tone relieved by cuffs and collar of cream
duchess. She was very slender and erect.
Her mass of brown hair, touched with gray,
was always dressed in the same style. During
all the years she had been at Exeter, it
had been worn in a great coil on the top of
her head. Dr. Morgan was no longer young.
During the last year, she had been compelled
to use eye-glasses. These were attached
to her bodice by a gold chain. As she
talked they were held in her hand the
greater part of the time. In physique, Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
Hogue was Dr. Morgan&#8217;s double. Robed
in the black gown, which she had borrowed
from Dr. Morgan&#8217;s maid, and with her hair
powdered, she could have easily passed as
the doctor herself.</p>
<p>Miss Bowman, in company with her fourteen
Seniors, sat in the greenroom and
waited. There was no lack of conversation,
although Miss Bowman took little part in
it. However, she was an interested listener,
and laughed heartily at the remarks of her
charges. They threatened her; they cajoled;
they flattered; they offered her all
the good things that could be laid at a Senior&#8217;s
feet during Commencement. When
these availed nothing, they expressed themselves
strongly. At intervals of a few minutes,
one of the girls would try the doors,
shaking them, and pounding with her fists
on the panels.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are other Seniors somewhere,&#8221;
cried Mary Wilson. &#8220;If we could make
them hear, we &#8217;d soon be out of here. We&#8217;d
stop the Middlers&#8217; banquet.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span></p>
<p>Miss Bowman laughed. &#8220;Do you still
think it is a banquet? Well, it isn&#8217;t. They
hadn&#8217;t the least idea of giving one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I saw the letter that Elizabeth Hobart
sent to Achenbach, the caterer. Isn&#8217;t
that proof enough?&#8221; And Mary looked as
if, had this been a legal case, she had Blackstone
on her side.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw the orders myself,&#8221; she asseverated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you did! Elizabeth intended
you should!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if there was not going to be a banquet,
why should they take all the trouble
to make us believe there was?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because, while you were hunting on the
wrong scent, they could go on with their
plans. You poor Seniors,&#8221; compassionately,
&#8220;how you did work to stop that banquet!
Landis had her trip to the city for
nothing. Do you know, I don&#8217;t believe you
could have had it served in the laundry! It
gets chilly and damp there in the evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get out of this! I won&#8217;t stay locked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
up,&#8221; cried Mary. &#8220;Come, girls, let&#8217;s all
yell together and pound on the floor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pandemonium reigned for a few moments.
Miss Bowman, exasperatingly cool,
sat smiling. When the clamor ceased, she
said, &#8220;Really, you are very childish. Why
not accept this with the spirit of philosophers?
You are here&mdash;you cannot get out
until the Middlers see fit. Why not sit
down and converse sweetly? There&#8217;s the
weather. It&#8217;s a safe subject. Nothing personal
about it. Or if you wish&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up!&#8221; cried Mary, stamping her
feet, and wholly losing her temper. &#8220;If
you had that key we&#8217;d fall upon you tooth
and nail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And take it from you!&#8221; It was Landis
who finished the remark.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I thought!&#8221; responded Miss Bowman
complacently. &#8220;That&#8217;s why I haven&#8217;t
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Min Kean who first showed the
spirit of a philosopher. &#8220;Oh, what&#8217;s the
use of fussing about it? We&#8217;re here, and I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
suppose we shall stay here until those Middlers
see fit to let us out. The more fuss we
make, the more fun for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this Landis drew herself erect.
&#8220;That is just what I was about to say. A
great deal of their fun will vanish when
they discover that it is all one to us whether
we get out or stay here. I&#8217;m about as
well satisfied. My throat was a little husky
anyway. Perhaps I would not have been
able to make that high note. How mortified
I should have been!&#8221;</p>
<p>She spoke in seeming sincerity. Mary
Wilson eyed her suspiciously. She sighed.
&#8220;Landis believes that we are what we make
people believe we are. You would make a
capital actress, Landis. The only fault you
have is that you would always be playing
to the gallery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her hearers laughed, accepting the remark
as a bit of pleasant chatter. Mary
did not fully grasp how much truth her remarks
contained. Landis alone appreciated
the words. Her face flushed and she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
turned her head aside for an instant that
the girls might not see she was hurt.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know but that it is a good
thing,&#8221; Mary rattled on. &#8220;We&#8217;re sure of
an audience, at least. What shall we do
now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What can we do!&#8221; wailed a meek-looking
little Senior from the darkest corner of
the room. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing except ask
conundrums. I&#8217;ll begin. Why did we
ever&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What more do you want?&#8221; asked Landis,
turning about quickly to face them.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll begin. What goes around a&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush hush,&#8221; came a chorus of whispers.
From the chapel below music could be
heard. It was the Germania orchestra of
twelve pieces from the city, to secure which
the Seniors had heavily taxed themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;All that music going to waste,&#8221; wailed
the little figure from the dark corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not going to waste, dearly beloved,&#8221;
came the response from Miss Bowman.
&#8220;The Middlers will enjoy it even more than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
you would have done. They are not paying
the bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>The instant the music ceased, the drop
went up. Again a groan arose from the
prisoners. They could see all that was enacted
on the stage, yet could not hear the
words.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Dr. Morgan,&#8221; whispered Mary.
&#8220;She can&#8217;t know that anything is wrong,
and that we are locked up here. When she
turns toward us I&#8217;ll tap, and she&#8217;ll see to
it that we are set free.&#8221;</p>
<p>A tall and stately figure, in an imported
gown of black lace, crossed the stage.
Reaching the center she paused, raised her
eye-glasses and swept the audience with her
characteristic glance. She began her remarks,
and had said but a few words when
she was stopped by a round of applause.
The Seniors who had not been booked for
that evening&#8217;s performance understood that
something had gone amiss. There were
hurried remarks&mdash;&#8220;It isn&#8217;t the Doctor;&#8221;
&#8220;It&#8217;s that Miss Hogue;&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;That&#8217;s the girl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
that&#8217;s in our classics;&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;This is the Middlers&#8217;
work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Hogue, following Dr. Morgan&#8217;s
manner, gave almost word for word the address
of the morning. She did it well. A
round of applause followed her from the
stage. She returned to receive the flowers
which were intended for Dr. Morgan, then
announced as the next number an oration
by Miss Wilson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I couldn&#8217;t hear what she was talking
about,&#8221; sighed Mary from her place in
the greenroom. &#8220;But it was just the way
Dr. Morgan would have done. Did you notice
how she raised her glasses, then turned
her head to look sharply? The Doctor does
that every time. Who&#8217;s this dressed in&mdash;&#8221;
She didn&#8217;t finish her question. She paused
to look closely. Then exclaimed, &#8220;Oh,
Elizabeth Hobart, you little Spaniard!
And with my dress on, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth swept across the stage. She
paused a moment, then tossed back her
hair.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Wilson!&#8221; &#8220;Miss Wilson!&#8221; came
the appreciative cries from the Freshmen
and specials sitting below. The Seniors, in
little groups of twos and threes, had their
heads together arranging for a general action.
They were so scattered throughout
the house that quick planning was impossible.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am charged with pride and ambition,&#8221;
began Elizabeth, in the same tones and with
the same gestures she had heard and seen
Mary use hundreds of times while practicing.
Even those in the greenroom caught
her words.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve another charge against her,&#8221; exclaimed
Miss Wilson. &#8220;She&#8217;s purloined my
dress. Oh, I wish she would look this way.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Elizabeth was wise. She let no
glance wander toward the greenroom.
She tossed back her locks again, threw out
her hands and continued, &#8220;The charge is
true, and I glory in its truth. Whoever
achieved anything great in letters, arts or
arms who was not ambitious? Cæsar was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
not more ambitious than Cicero. It was
only in another way.&#8221; She went through
the oration without a pause, and bowed herself
from the stage in the midst of a round
of hearty applause from the delighted audience.</p>
<p>Dr. Morgan, with her usual dignity, announced
that Miss Landis Stoner from Potter
County being absent by <i>foreseen</i> circumstances,
Miss Mame Welch would sing the
&#8220;Jewel Song&#8221; from Faust.</p>
<p>Mame, resplendent but uncomfortable in
the finery belonging to Landis, then appeared.
She raised her head, straightened
her shoulders, looking unutterably bored and
weary, although self-confident enough for a
score of such songs. But the instant her
voice arose, the Seniors who had gotten together
started to sing. Their voices filled
the chapel, drowning out even the laughter
and applause.</p>

<p>The moment there was a lull, Miss Welch
caught her own tune and started bravely
on her song, only to be again drowned out.
She did not give up. She sang in spite of
all opposition, for the most part out of the
tune. Then with the airs and manner of
one who had succeeded beyond all expectations,
she left the stage, in some disorder
but not vanquished.</p>
<p>The pseudo Dr. Morgan then arose, and
with the dignity born of her position and
years, requested order, saying that if there
was further interruption she must ask the
watchmen present to expel the disturbing
element. Her speech was a master stroke.
Exeter then had a dozen special officers
about the grounds and buildings. Most of
them had never been in Dr. Morgan&#8217;s presence.
Those in attendance, not understanding
the state of affairs, took the request in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
good faith, believing that it was the real
Dean of Exeter addressing them.</p>
<p>Then the farce which the Seniors had
prepared was played.</p>
<p>Nancy, or the &#8220;boiled lobster,&#8221; as she had
nicknamed herself, was last to appear.</p>
<p>She played on Nora O&#8217;Day&#8217;s guitar &#8220;The
Spanish Cavalier,&#8221; the only selection she
could pick out, and sang it in a weak, trembling
soprano. Nora both sang and played
well. Nancy, in her vivid orange gown, did
her best. Her audience, by this time conscious
that there was something amiss,
could no longer be suppressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could he ever think of anything else?&#8221;
came in a stage-whisper from below.
Every one heard, and every one smiled.
Nancy sang on:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame him,&#8221; came again. Laughter
swept over the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother about returning&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Nancy laughed aloud. The curtain fell.
The program for the evening was finished.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<h3>RETALIATION.</h3>
</div>

<p>The Seniors accepted the Middlers&#8217; fun
in good part. Even Mary forgave Elizabeth
the wearing of her new gown.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; Mary had exclaimed after the
affair was over, and a group of girls had
gathered in her room, &#8220;&#8216;Every dog has his
day.&#8217; We had ours last year; and next
year you will pay the fiddler for a new set
of Middlers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they don&#8217;t pay before that,&#8221; said
Landis, sententiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a long lane that has no turning,&#8221;
said Min.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we will leave before the turn
comes,&#8221; laughed Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;What will you do?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Jump the fence and take to the fields,&#8221;
was Elizabeth&#8217;s reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I wear my orange gown to-night will
I look like Nancy?&#8221; asked Nora O&#8217;Day.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope not,&#8221; said Nancy, while a chorus
of strong negatives arose from the other
girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll wear it,&#8221; said Nora.</p>
<p>The excellent spirit with which the Seniors
took their imprisonment was quite
enough to awaken suspicion in the minds of
Middlers had they been in a cautious mood.
But they were too uplifted with their recent
success to think of aught else. Beside,
there was little time now for planning and
executing vengeance. Dr. Morgan gave a
tea to the Seniors and their friends late
that afternoon. Thursday evening was the
date for the ball and banquet. Friday the
general exodus would begin.</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you on hand for this morning?&#8221;
asked Mary, as she and Elizabeth
were dressing for breakfast.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s plenty. I&#8217;m undecided what to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
do. One party is going boating; another
plans to take a tally-ho ride, and have lunch
under the trees which mark the place of the
Wyoming massacre. The Freshmen are
having a small &#8220;feed&#8221; down in room B.
Everyone in this hall is invited. It&#8217;s a mild
affair. Just drop in, eat a sandwich and
salad, exchange addresses, and bow yourself
out. I think I&#8217;ll go out boating first and
then attend the Freshmen&#8217;s &#8216;drop-in.&#8217; And
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary sighed. &#8220;I must rest a little for
Dr. Morgan&#8217;s &#8216;at home.&#8217; I haven&#8217;t had
enough sleep for a week. I know I look
like Medusa. I&#8217;ll start my packing, sort of
get my personal belongings into shape. If
I have time, I may walk down to the boat-house.
But don&#8217;t wait for me. Any one
of a score of trifles may delay me.&#8221;</p>
<p>This conversation took place about eight
o&#8217;clock. That was the last the two girls
saw of each other until Mary, decked out in
her new gown, came down the hall on the
way to Dr. Morgan&#8217;s apartments. Elizabeth,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
dusty and tired, had that moment returned
from the day&#8217;s outing.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been out in the sun, with only
that brimless cap on your head,&#8221; was Mary&#8217;s
greeting. &#8220;I should have warned you how
sunny that boat ride is. I see two new
freckles on the bridge of your nose now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if there&#8217;s only two, I shan&#8217;t mind.
When will you be back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In half an hour or so. Put on your
cream colored dress for dinner. There&#8217;s to
be doings afterward, and you&#8217;ll be ready.
Were any of our girls with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I haven&#8217;t seen one to-day; neither at
the boat-house nor on our ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>During commencement week, the regular
order of meals was infringed upon. Dinner
began earlier and lasted later than usual.
The students took second place, giving precedence
to the guests and Seniors. So it
came about that the Middlers and Freshmen
had scarcely finished before time for the beginning
of the evening festivities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every one is to go to chapel after dinner,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
someone started the order. It was
passed on and on until all the girls of the
first and second classes received the word.</p>
<p>The dresses which they had worn to dinner
answered for such an informal affair as
this must be, to judge from the manner of
issuing the invitations.</p>
<p>As they quitted the dining-hall, Elizabeth
looked about for Mary, but could not find
her. Nora, Landis, Min and Anna Cresswell
also were among the missing. Then she
hurried to join Nancy and Mame.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary is not to be found. Perhaps she
has already gone to chapel.&#8221;</p>
<p>The audience hall was almost filled when
they entered. Bright fans on the wing
looked like a swarm of gay butterflies.
The subdued hush of conversation came
from all parts of the room. Elizabeth
looked about but could not see her roommate.</p>
<p>&#8220;How perfectly awful the stage looks!&#8221;
whispered Mame, who possessed the artistic
temperament. &#8220;I think I could have decorated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
it better than that. I feel mournful
at the mere looking at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stage had been robbed of its furniture.
A high-backed chair and reading-desk
of black walnut were the only pieces
in sight. White roses were there in profusion
but not one bit of color.</p>
<p>While conversation buzzed, and fans
fluttered, Azzie, dressed as somberly as the
rostrum looked, walked slowly down the
main aisle. Her gown was of some thin
black stuff. She suited her walk and expression
to match the color of her dress.
She wore no flowers. A big roll of music
was in her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s going to play.&#8221; Each one
straightened her shoulders and leaned
eagerly forward, fairly holding her breath
in anticipation, for Azzie&#8217;s fame as a pianist
was far-reaching.</p>
<p>Moving slowly to the front of the rostrum,
she seated herself at the piano. So she sat
for a few moments without touching the
keys.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span></p>
<p>Slowly following her came Anna Cresswell,
in gown but no cap. Her linen collar
and cuffs showed white against the dead
black of her student&#8217;s robe. With glances
neither to right nor left, she slowly advanced,
mounted the rostrum, and solemnly
seated herself in the high-backed chair of
polished walnut. Then Azzie touched the
keys and gave expression to the most melancholy
dirge one could conceive. So sympathetic
was her music that a hush fell over
the chattering audience.</p>
<p>&#8220;What has possessed the girl?&#8221; whispered
Mame Welch, almost in tears but determined
to keep a brave front. &#8220;I feel as
though I was about to attend my own funeral.
This is so unlike Azzie. Her music
is generally brilliant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still the wail of sorrow sobbed itself out
from beneath Azzie&#8217;s fingers. In a moment
more, the audience would have been in tears.
She sat for a moment silent. When she
touched the keys again, it was to give expression
to a march, measured, heavy, solemn.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
At this, emerging from the rear of
the chapel came the Seniors, in caps and
gowns, two by two, with heads bowed, and
&#8220;faces as long as the moral law,&#8221; whispered
Mame to Elizabeth.</p>
<p>The first six carried between them a long
narrow box, over which the Middler class
colors, green and white, had been draped,
and on which rested a stiff wreath of white
artificial flowers tied with streamers of vivid
green. Advancing to the front, the six
bearers deposited their burden before the
rostrum, then took their places with the
other robed figures upon the front seats.
All the while Azzie played her solemn dead
march.</p>
<p>At the conclusion, Miss Cresswell arose to
announce they would begin the services by
singing the popular ballad &#8220;Go tell Aunt
Nancy.&#8221; At this, the mournful singers,
with Azzie accompanying them, sang in
wailing, heart-broken voices:

<p>Each Senior did her part well, maintaining
an expression which was the picture of
grief. At the close of the song, Miss Cresswell
advanced to the reading-stand. She
assumed an oratorical tone. There was a
note of pathos in all she said. &#8220;There came
to Exeter Hall some ten months ago,&#8221; she
began, &#8220;the class whose early demise we are
now making famous with these ceremonies.
They were young then. They continued to
remain young&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So young,&#8221; came in a sad-voiced chorus
from the singers.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were green,&mdash;they remained so until
their passing away. I repeat, they were
green&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, so green,&#8221; came the sobbing chorus.</p>
<p>&#8220;The faculty looked upon them and
sighed, a great sigh of disappointment. Yet
with that noble heartedness, that philanthropic
desire to feed the hungry, clothe the
naked, minister unto the feeble-minded
which marks our honored Dr. Morgan and
her fellow workers, they took up the burden,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
determined to do their best. Yet,
despite their great efforts, the class did not
advance as other classes have done. Nor
yet could it retrograde for it stood in a position
where any backward movement was
impossible. It was known throughout Exeter
as the &#8216;caudal appendage&#8217; class, being
&#8216;away back.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Seniors, too, did all that lay in their
power to enlighten these Middlers both intellectually
and morally. But our efforts
were like &#8216;casting pearls before swine.&#8217;
The Middlers were not only no better for
our efforts, but seemed wholly unconscious
that they stood in need of moral and intellectual
support.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet none of us regret the work that we
did in their behalf. We planted the seed,
but the soil was barren. Our efforts toward
their cultivation was like breathing a concord
of sweet sound into a vacuum. There
was no volume of matter to perpetuate and
carry it forth. It is not that we wish to
censure them. Lacking the capacity to enjoy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
the higher life of school, we can not
blame them that they amused themselves
with mere toys. We Seniors who wear the
philosopher&#8217;s cap and gown must bear in
mind that it would ill become the clown or
jester. We listen to the music which rolls
down the ages; but the tinkle of the bells
won the ears of the Middlers. It is ever
so. The world cannot be all of the higher
ideal element. They cannot all be Seniors.&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused to touch the colors of the Middler
class&mdash;green and white.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are the symbols of the late lamented
Middler class. How appropriate!
The white represents the conditions of the
examination sheets they habitually handed
in&mdash;not a line, not a letter. Blank, quite
blank. It is the opinion of the faculty that
this also represented the condition of their
brains. I do not fully agree with this. I
believe that at rare intervals, and when
under the influence of proper environment,
for example, the presence of some Senior,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span>
the minds of the Middlers did receive some
impression;&mdash;slight, we acknowledge. Yet
we hold an impression, a faint suggestion of
an idea, was there.</p>
<p>&#8220;The second color! Green! How beautiful,
how appropriate. It represents our
lamented Middlers as they stood before the
world. They were so verdant!</p>
<p>&#8220;As to the age of the departed class, both
much and little might be said. The records
show that as a class they existed just ten
short months; to the faculty and Seniors it
seems like ten long years.</p>
<p>&#8220;During their sojourn, the hospital of
Exeter has been filled with&mdash;teachers suffering
from nervous prostration. Dr. Morgan&#8217;s
ebony locks have turned silver. During
the holidays Miss Wilhelm, who tried to
teach them classics, in a fit of desperation
sought refuge in matrimony. We might
speak more fully of the effects of their being
among us were it not that we believe in interring
the evil they have done with their
bones.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span></p>
<p>&#8220;With this short eulogy, I close. Miss
Stoner, a Senior, who has suffered much because
of the shortcomings of the Middlers,
will sing a solo appropriate to the occasion,
the others joining in the chorus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Landis advanced. Azzie struck up an accompaniment,
while the whole class of Seniors
came out strong on the refrain.</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>With this, the Seniors arose. Six again
took possession of the long box. The procession
filed slowly from the room, while
Azzie played a dirge.</p>
<p>The Middlers and Freshmen followed
after them, and the laughing and chattering
began again. Every one was humming
&#8220;The Middler&mdash;class&mdash;is dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>The line of girls passed down the main
hall, the audience following them to see what
new thing was to take place.</p>
<p>The members of the faculty, with Dr.
Morgan, stood here. At the sight of their
smile-wreathed faces, the gravity of the
Seniors gave way. Landis laughed aloud.
The others followed her example. The lines
broke. The girls gathered about the teachers,
talking and making merry over their
escapade.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never realized what a nervous strain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span>
it is to control oneself so long,&#8221; said Nora,
joining Dr. Morgan. &#8220;I felt as though I
must shriek and laugh, and there I had to
sit and pretend to be overcome with sorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Morgan had been glancing over a special
edition of the evening paper. She
folded it quickly as Nora came up to her.
&#8220;You did admirably, Miss O&#8217;Day,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I could not be present all the while.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nora O&#8217;Day did not hear. She was leaning
forward, her lips parted; her eyes,
bright with excitement, were upon the paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I see this for a moment, Dr. Morgan?&#8221;
she asked excitedly. &#8220;What is it
about the strike?&#8221;</p>
<p>She had the paper in her hand, reading
the article before Dr. Morgan had time to
reply. It was a full resumé of the trouble
at Bitumen from early fall until the present,
telling of the threatened attack upon
Superintendent Hobart and the new miners
and the call for State troops. The correspondent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span>
prophesied that the militia could
not arrive in time to prevent bloodshed, the
capital being two hundred miles from the
scene of trouble, and the railway up the
mountain having already been destroyed by
the miners.</p>
<p>Nora grasped the meaning instantly.
There was no mention made of the name of
Dennis O&#8217;Day. He was not a miner. In
the eyes of the world, he had no power.
Miners themselves did not realize that it
was he alone who instigated the strike, and
that their leaders had been his choice. Outwardly,
Dennis O&#8217;Day had washed his
hands of the whole affair. So long as he
escaped legal responsibility, he would shrug
his shoulders, and stand by to watch the
fight. He could be eliminated without effecting
the result. But Nora O&#8217;Day, who
understood her father as no one else had
ever understood him, saw his work here.
She knew that for years he had been the
unseen moving power.</p>
<p>The bubble of laughter and fun was about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span>
her. She looked up piteously into Dr.
Morgan&#8217;s face, her lips trembling with emotion.
She loved her father. Shame and
fear for him overwhelmed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I know&mdash;some&mdash;some people there.
That is why I&mdash;I was anxious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you would not mention the matter
to anyone. We see no reason to distress
Miss Hobart unnecessarily. Her knowing
the condition of affairs would result in
needless worry without helping matters
any.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;Elizabeth&mdash;is she&mdash;has she&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her father, you know, Miss O&#8217;Day, is
the superintendent of the Bitumen mines.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that Nora O&#8217;Day gave a startled cry,
and buried her face in her hands. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t&mdash;know&mdash;I didn&#8217;t know. Poor Elizabeth&mdash;&#8221;
she sobbed.</p>
<p>Her behavior was claiming the attention
of others. To shield her from the attention
of the passing throng, Dr. Morgan drew her
within the private office. She anticipated
comforting an hysterical girl. But in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span>
moment Miss O&#8217;Day controlled herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;When will the troops reach Bitumen?&#8221;
she asked, drawing herself up, afire with
purpose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not before to-morrow night. That is
the earliest possible time. It is presumed
the miners, hearing of the call for help, will
bring matters to a climax at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Morgan, will you telephone McCantey&#8217;s
livery? They know my father down
there. Tell them to send the man Jefferies
if they can, and fast horses. Elizabeth Hobart
and I will go to Bitumen to-night. I&#8217;ll
stop the trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear child, you&#8217;re&mdash;crazy,&#8221; said Dr.
Morgan, surprised by such a suggestion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Far from it. I&#8217;m going, with or without
your permission. Please telephone
now, and I&#8217;ll explain while I await their
coming. Tell them it&#8217;s a matter of life and
death. If I kill the horses with hard driving,
I&#8217;ll pay twice what they&#8217;re worth.
Every minute counts! Won&#8217;t you telephone?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span></p>
<p>Dr. Morgan obeyed the peremptory request.
She believed that news of the strike
had affected Nora until she did not know
what she was about. She would accede to
her request, and perhaps by the time the
horses were at the Hall, Miss O&#8217;Day would
listen to reason.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Nora, the order having been
given, &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you some facts about myself
and my family you never knew. I
know who has brought this strike about, and
I know how to stop it.&#8221; She spoke calmly,
methodically. Dr. Morgan seated herself
to listen. Miss O&#8217;Day began her story.
When she had finished, the horses were at
the door, Jefferies with them. Dr. Morgan
hesitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve known Jefferies for years. He is
a friend of my father. He will take care
of us,&#8221; said Nora, studying the expression
of Dr. Morgan&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then go, Nora. My prayers go with
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Elizabeth, the center
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span>
of a laughing group, was drawn hurriedly
aside by Nora.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a long storm coat. Put it on
over your light dress. We have no time
to change. Put on the cap, and tie a heavy
veil upon it. It is raining; but it will matter
little.&#8221; The speaker was enveloped in a
long, dark, travelling cloak, beneath which
her orange colored gown showed. A soft
hat swathed in a heavy veil hid her head
and face.</p>
<p>Elizabeth did as she was bid, being wholly
carried away by the excitement and force
in the speaker&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;what&mdash;&#8221; she began.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t waste time talking. There, you
are ready. Come!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go with your friend,&#8221; said Dr. Morgan.
&#8220;She will tell you on the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>She walked with them to the door. The
girls passed out into the storm and the
night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<h3>VICTORY.</h3>
</div>

<p>The country roads were almost ankle deep
with mud. The soft drizzling rain had resolved
itself into a steady downpour. The
carriage seemed swallowed up in the darkness.
It was well that Jefferies knew the
way and the horses he was driving. He
chirruped and called them by name and they
went plunging on through the mire.</p>
<p>No sooner were the girls seated in the
conveyance, the storm-robes being drawn
about them, than Elizabeth turned to her
companion with eager questioning. She
was quivering with suppressed excitement.</p>
<p>Nora, on the contrary, was quite calm.
She had made her plans, and now saw her
way clear to carry them out. Her self-confidence
spared her unnecessary alarm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span>
However, appreciating Elizabeth&#8217;s state of
mind, she at once explained the condition of
affairs at Bitumen. She was sufficiently
tactful to tell her only that which was necessary
for her to know. She also warned her
to be careful what she said should anyone
stop them on the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we meet the strikers, they will help
us along because I am the daughter of Dennis
O&#8217;Day. But they must not know who
you are. On the other hand, if we meet
anyone else, you are to impress them with
the fact that you are Superintendent Hobart&#8217;s
only child, and that you <i>must</i> reach
Bitumen to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Turning to Jefferies, she urged him to
keep the horses moving. &#8220;I know the carriage
will be ruined, and the horses laid up
with stiff joints for a week or more; but
I&#8217;ll pay for that. Get us to Bitumen before
daylight, and Mr. McCantey may make the
bill what he chooses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although they were moving as fast as it
was possible it seemed but a snail&#8217;s pace to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span>
Elizabeth. She could realize nothing but
that her father was in danger. After hearing
Nora&#8217;s reasons for this sudden journey,
she spoke no word but sat rigid, her hands
clasped tightly in her lap. She was leaning
forward, trying to pierce the darkness of
the road before them. The rain beat into
her face. Her cap and veil were drenched
but she heeded them not.</p>
<p>Determined to make the journey a trifle
less strenuous for Elizabeth, Nora kept up
a continuous flow of talk. It mattered little
about what; only that there was no
silence, but Elizabeth might as well have
been a wooden girl so far as listening to
her companion was concerned. They left
the flat country roads, and began ascending
the mountain. The road was so narrow
that heavy logs had been placed for safety
along the outer side.</p>
<p>For the first time since the beginning of
their journey Jefferies spoke: &#8220;We should
make better time here. The roads are well
enough trained, and we would if I could see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span>
a yard ahead of me. I&#8217;ll let the horses go
their own gait&mdash;they&#8217;re sure-footed enough.
All we&#8217;ve got to do is to trust in Providence.
I&#8217;ll get you there or kill the horses in trying.&#8221;</p>
<p>At last, at the opening of a small ravine,
the road broadened. The horses sprang forward.</p>
<p>Suddenly Elizabeth, still looking eagerly
ahead, exclaimed, &#8220;I see a light! It looks
like a lantern.&#8221;</p>
<p>The click of the horses&#8217; hoofs upon the
stones rang loud and clear. Jefferies drew
them up. He leaned over sidewise to peer
about. &#8220;I was trying to see just where we
are. Oh, we&#8217;re all right. That light hain&#8217;t
no lantern. That&#8217;s where Ketchomunoski
lives. We&#8217;ll go on. He may come out if
he hears us go by. I&#8217;ll go slow and whip
up just as we reach his shanty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he a miner?&#8221; It was Nora who
asked the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Draw down your veil, Elizabeth, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span>
don&#8217;t say a word to him. I&#8217;ll do the talking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scarcely had she spoken when the flickering
light moved out into the road, directly
in their way. Ketchomunoski, lantern in
hand, barred their way.</p>
<p>Jefferies could have urged the horses on,
letting the big Polander run the risk of
getting beneath their hoofs. But Jefferies
was a peaceful man, so long as peace served
his purpose. If strategy served, he preferred
it to war; if not, then he was ready
for the last. At the flourish of the lantern,
he drew rein, calling out in friendly tone:
&#8220;That you, John?&#8221; By that name every
foreigner was known. &#8220;Come here, I want
to speak to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Pole came to the side of the carriage.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get to Bitumen, John, and
get there to-night. How&#8217;s the road?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one go to there to-night,&#8221; he replied,
in his broken English. He was to watch the
road. Men were above. He would fire his
gun if any one suspicious passed. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span>
could not go on. This was the purport of
his speech.</p>
<p>Leaning forward, Nora touched the man&#8217;s
arm. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know me?&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I&#8217;m Dennis O&#8217;Day&#8217;s daughter. Listen!
I must reach my father at once. <i>At once</i>,
do you understand? I have a message to
give him which will affect the strike. But
<i>I</i> must give it to him. Fire your gun, and
let the miners meet us. I want them to
take me to my father.&#8221;</p>
<p>She kept her hand on the man&#8217;s arm as
she was speaking. She looked him directly
in the eye, as though by force of her own
will she would compel him to do her bidding.
Her words threw a new light upon
the case. Yet in times like this, one can
trust the words of no one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where have I seen you?&#8221; he asked,
scrutinizing her closely.</p>
<p>Her face flushed, but she answered
bravely. &#8220;Do you remember two years ago,
you came to my father for help? One of
your people was in jail&mdash;someone had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span>
hurt, killed, perhaps. An Italian named
De Angelo. And my father went to court
with you to tell that Gerani, I think that
was his name, was not present when the
Italian was hurt. I was at home when you
came.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man nodded. There was no question
now in his mind. She was Dennis
O&#8217;Day&#8217;s daughter, the daughter of the man,
who, although himself not a miner, stood
shoulder to shoulder with them when they
needed a friend. She saw him hesitate.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are afraid to allow us to pass, fire
your gun, and let the miners know we&#8217;re
coming. I am not afraid of them. They
will befriend me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stepped aside. At that instant Jefferies
brought down his whip upon the
backs of the horses, and they started forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re rid of him,&#8221; exclaimed Nora.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid of anyone else. I&#8217;ll reach
Bitumen and see my father before daylight.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368' name='page_368'></a>368</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And save mine,&#8221; said Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Elizabeth Hobart, your father is perfectly
safe. No doubt, he&#8217;s home warm and
comfortable in bed, while we, poor mortals,
are out in the night, drenched and forlorn.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had not gone up the mountain road
more than a mile, when the sharp report of
a gun was heard. There was a moment&#8217;s
silence, followed by a second report.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ketchomunoski is sending word of our
coming,&#8221; said Nora. &#8220;I begin to feel that
I am of some importance. This is the first
time my appearance has been heralded.&#8221;
Then more seriously, &#8220;I would like to know
what two shots mean. Why wasn&#8217;t one sufficient?
Do you know, Jefferies?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Jefferies knew nothing. He would
not even express an opinion on the subject.
He had no time to give to mere surmises.
His work was to keep the horses moving.
This he did, encouraging them with chirrups,
or touching them lightly with the
whip.</p>
<p>Though on the mountain road there was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369' name='page_369'></a>369</span>
no mud, for the steep ascent was well-drained,
it was hard traveling even for
strong and swift horses. Jefferies&#8217; heart
smote him as he urged them on. He knew
the horses he was driving would be useless
for weeks, but if a man&#8217;s life hung in the
balance, the horses must travel their best,
though they drop dead at the end of the
journey.</p>
<p>The road from the foot to the top of the
mountain was between three and four miles
long. It had been cut along the side of the
hill, and was so narrow that teams could not
pass except at certain places, widened sufficiently
to give &#8216;turning-out&#8217; room.</p>
<p>Jefferies had stopped at one of these
places to rest his horses. Upon the instant
they reared and would have plunged the
carriage backward over the side, had not
their driver retained his presence of mind
to speak to them, leaning over to pat their
sweating flanks. After quieting them, he
called out: &#8220;Now you fellows attempt to
seize the bridle again, and I&#8217;ll let you see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370' name='page_370'></a>370</span>
how close I can shoot to the mark. The
horses won&#8217;t stand strangers fooling about
them. If you&#8217;ve anything to say, come
alongside and say it. But bear in mind,
we&#8217;ll not put up with any funny business.
Are you coming? If you don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll drive
on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you a revolver?&#8221; whispered Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think I would take a drive
like this without one, do you?&#8221; was the reply.</p>
<p>At his invitation, dark forms emerged
from the bushes and from behind the trees.
As they advanced, it seemed as though the
road was filled with men. They came close,
swinging their lanterns high to see the occupants
of the carriage. They were a sorry-looking
set. The winter had been hard
upon them, though the fault was their own.
They had had little to eat; they had grown
thin and haggard; their eyes were sunken;
their features pinched. They jabbered in
their own tongue, turning from one to another.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span>
Elizabeth noticed with alarm that
some bore firearms, while others carried
clubs and even stones. She was so frightened
that she could not have spoken a word
had her life depended upon it. Fortunately
Nora was different. Elizabeth
crouched back in her seat. Nora leaned
forward, and with a manner indicative of
her ability to protect herself, and her confidence
in them, she addressed them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad we met you,&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;You are miners? Then you can tell me
how to reach Mr. Dennis O&#8217;Day. I must
reach him to-night&mdash;within a few hours. I
have a message for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>They talked among themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the message?&#8221; one asked in
broken English.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not to be told to every one,&#8221; she replied.
&#8220;If you will tell me who your leader
is, I&#8217;ll whisper it to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ivan,&#8221; they cried, pushing a Slav forward,
and retreating into the shadows.</p>
<p>Bending over, Nora mentioned &#8220;Militia.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372' name='page_372'></a>372</span>
The word was magic. Then she grew impatient.
&#8220;Why do you try to keep us
here?&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t Ketchomunoski
fire two guns? Wasn&#8217;t that to let you
know we would come this road and that you
should let us pass? We are wasting time.
I must reach my father with this message.
Good night! Jefferies, drive on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men made no effort to detain them as
the carriage started. It was past one
o&#8217;clock when they reached the top of the
mountain and came to the outskirts of the
town. &#8220;The Miners&#8217; Rest&#8221; was less than
a mile distant. But the horses were tired
out. Jefferies could not get them out of a
slow walk.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go at once to &#8216;The Miners&#8217;
Rest,&#8217;&#8221; said Miss O&#8217;Day. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see my
father there. If the miners are planning
any trouble, they&#8217;ll be there, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Driving into a little wood, Jefferies drew
rein. Climbing down from his place, he
took out a strap and tied the horses to a
tree.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373' name='page_373'></a>373</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t let us drive through
town,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;The streets will be
filled with the strikers. We&#8217;ll walk, keeping
in the shadows. It&#8217;s a blessed good
thing for us that it rains.&#8221;</p>
<p>He helped the girls to alight, then strode
on ahead, skirting the edge of the wood.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you see me stop, then you stop,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t come on until I say so. If
you hear me talk to anyone, wait and don&#8217;t
speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clasping hands, the girls slowly followed.
The side of the road was filled with clods.
The road itself was mud to the shoe tops.
Many times they stumbled and almost fell.
Only at intervals could they see the form of
their guide.</p>
<p>When they reached the main street, Jefferies
paused. It was filled with miners,
each with his lantern. These lights helped
Jefferies to determine his next move. He
saw in which direction the crowd tended.
The murmur of many voices could be heard;
but there was no uproar.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374' name='page_374'></a>374</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The women will either be out in the
street with the men, or home asleep,&#8221; he
said at last. &#8220;Either way, we&#8217;re safe.
We&#8217;ll cross here and get behind this row of
houses and keep on until we&#8217;re close to &#8216;The
Miners&#8217; Rest.&#8217; They&#8217;ll see us then. But
no matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slowly they pushed their way through
backyards. Fortunately there were no division
fences. The winter&#8217;s crop of ashes
and tin cans was beneath their feet. They
stumbled, ran into barrels and boxes, waded
through mud holes, yet Nora&#8217;s spirits never
flagged.</p>
<p>As they came to the last of the houses,
Jefferies again paused until Nora and Elizabeth
came up to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;There at the corner is &#8216;The Miners&#8217;
Rest,&#8217;&#8221; he said, pointing to a low, wooden
building.</p>
<p>&#8220;That ramshackle affair!&#8221; cried Nora.
&#8220;Somehow I had the impression it was a
big hotel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t need that kind among miners,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375' name='page_375'></a>375</span>
was the reply. &#8220;This is just a drinking-place,
nothing more. Every miner in
Bitumen is there. Look at those women.
They&#8217;re worse than the men.&#8221;</p>
<p>A group of women with hair hanging,
dressed in dirty wrappers, and shawls about
their shoulders, stood together under the
flickering corner lamp. To judge from
their gesticulations, they were much excited.
They were all talking at once and
shaking their clenched fists in defiance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you afraid to go through that
mob?&#8221; asked Jefferies.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; we dare not be afraid of anything
now. Push ahead, Jefferies, straight to the
door, and on through until I find my father.
Don&#8217;t stop. We&#8217;ll keep at your heels.
Draw down your veil, Elizabeth, and put
up your collar. Don&#8217;t speak or tell who
you are. Remember the miners know you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Following her suggestion, Jefferies
crossed the street, pushing his way through
the throng, as though he was expected.
The girls kept close to him, so close that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376' name='page_376'></a>376</span>
Nora could have reached forth and touched
his arm. The mob of men scarcely noticed
him. Indeed, few knew that the two girls
had slipped through the crowd. They
were talking in half a dozen different
tongues and dialects. The effect was like a
pack of dogs snarling. No attempt was
made to stop the three. They reached the
door and Jefferies entered, followed by the
girls. Nora&#8217;s cheeks were crimson with
embarrassment. She was trembling. Her
nerves had been so wrought upon that she
was ready to cry. But that would spoil all.
She must control herself.</p>
<p>Behind the bar was a room devoted to
conferences of the leaders of the strike.
Toward the door leading to this Jefferies
made his way. The men in the bar-room
stopped talking to look at the girls. It was
unusual to see women in this place.</p>
<p>Nora, feeling herself conspicuous, with a
desire both to justify her presence there,
and to protect herself and companion, exclaimed,
&#8220;My father is in that room, Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377' name='page_377'></a>377</span>
Jefferies. Ask for Mr. O&#8217;Day. Tell him
his daughter has come with an important
message.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men stepped aside, leaving her way
clear. Her words had carried into the inner
room. The door was flung open from
within, and Dennis O&#8217;Day stood there.</p>
<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Good heavens,
Nora, how did you get here at such a time?
Come here,&#8221; and he drew the girls into the
inner room. He dismissed at once the half
dozen men gathered there. &#8220;In half an
hour,&#8221; he said significantly as they passed
out. &#8220;Not a minute before that. I must
see what has brought my daughter here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth, drenched and with draggled
skirts, sank into a chair. She had not
raised her veil. Dennis O&#8217;Day did not recognize
her as the little girl whom he had
seen many times playing about the superintendent&#8217;s
yard. She was so nearly exhausted
that she could not stand. She let
her head fall over upon the table.</p>
<p>Dennis O&#8217;Day glanced from the drooping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378' name='page_378'></a>378</span>
figure back to his daughter as though asking
an explanation. &#8220;My dearest friend at
Exeter, father,&#8221; was the reply to the unspoken
question. &#8220;No one else in the
world, except yourself, has been so kind to
me.&#8221; She came closer to Dennis O&#8217;Day,
touching his sleeve with her finger-tips.
His little world had always trembled in fear
of him. His daughter alone stood fearless
in his presence. She was the only being in
the world he loved. For an instant he
looked into her face. Her perfect features
and rich coloring delighted him. He was
glad that she was beautiful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Nora, what is it that has brought
you to Bitumen at this of all times?&#8221; he
asked, putting his arm about her and drawing
her close to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The strike.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The strike! It is just the reason that
you shouldn&#8217;t be here. I&#8217;ve a notion to
cart-whip Jefferies for bringing you. You
might have been shot by the miners.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I might. But Jefferies wasn&#8217;t asked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_379' name='page_379'></a>379</span>
anything about it, daddy. I told him he
<i>had</i> to bring me here before morning, and
if he killed the horses by hard driving,
you&#8217;d pay for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dennis O&#8217;Day laughed. He liked her
audacity. &#8220;But suppose I wouldn&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you would. You have never failed
me yet, daddy, and you never will. It
doesn&#8217;t matter much what happens, you&#8217;ll
stand by me. That is why I felt so sure
about coming. Dr. Morgan did not wish
me to. She said it would be useless. But
she yielded when I insisted that you would
do what was right. And you must do it
now, daddy.&#8221; She drew down his head to
kiss him. &#8220;You must keep the miners from
attacking the mines to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I? I&#8217;m no miner! What have I to do
with the strike? If the men attack that
miserable little sneak of a superintendent,
what have I to say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything. You are not a miner, but
they do as you say. They do not know it
is so, but you do. I want you to go out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_380' name='page_380'></a>380</span>
there; tell them&mdash;tell them anything, only
so they do not make the attack to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense. Even if they should do as
I say, what&#8217;s the odds? I&#8217;ve no love for
that man Hobart. He&#8217;s been fighting me
for years. He&#8217;ll get no more than he deserves.
No, no, Nora. Girls mustn&#8217;t meddle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; ask me anything else than that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;ll do. The
National Guards are on their way now.
When they come, I&#8217;ll give them all the information
they wish. I know who urged
this on. I know who killed the Italian.
Oh, I know lots of things that I&#8217;ve kept to
myself because my telling would harm you.
But&mdash;&#8221; She was excited. Whether she
pretended this high state of emotion, or
whether it was real, was difficult to tell.
She had flung open her coat. The vivid
coloring of her gown, her crimson cheeks
and flashing eyes made a brilliant bit of coloring
in the dark room lighted by a solitary,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381' name='page_381'></a>381</span>
smoking oil-lamp. Her tones were clear
and decisive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Nora, listen to reason. How&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I will not listen to anything but your
promise to go and stop that mob. Listen
to them yelling like a pack of hyenas. I&#8217;m
not through yet. You must choose and
choose quickly. Stand by the miners or
me. If you forsake me, I&#8217;ll never see you
again. I&#8217;ll never let you do anything for
me. I&#8217;ll be as though you never had a
daughter. Then what will be the good of
all your money and your saving? There&#8217;ll
be no one to waste it on; no one to care
about you. You know that mother left me
enough to live on. Besides, I can work.
Will you go?&#8221; She fairly blazed her words
at him. She stamped her foot until the
chairs and tables shook.</p>
<p>Dennis O&#8217;Day had been her slave since
babyhood. She had always had her way,
and had done as she had threatened. He
knew, too, that she was the only one who
had a bit of tenderness for him. The men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382' name='page_382'></a>382</span>
outside cared little for him. Fear of the
consequences was the sole reason that many
a miner had not quietly assisted him into
the next world.</p>
<p>Nora came up to him again. She rested
her head against his shoulder. &#8220;Listen,
daddy, to what I tell you,&#8221; she said gently,
her anger disappearing. In a few words
she told him of her isolation at school, and
how Elizabeth Hobart had befriended her.
Her eyes filled as she talked. Her hearer,
too, was moved. When she had finished,
she kissed him again. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be to you the
best daughter a man ever had. Go now,&#8221;
pushing him toward the door. &#8220;And tell
them that I have brought you news which
changes the program. I&#8217;ll go with you,
daddy. If they harm you, I&#8217;ll bear the
blows too.&#8221;</p>
<p>He told her to stay, but she followed close
after him. He had no fear of bodily harm.
There would be growls and snarls, and perhaps
threats, but the trouble would end
there. Gerani, Colowski, Raffelo, Sickerenza,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_383' name='page_383'></a>383</span>
were the bell-sheep. He could control
them.</p>
<p>Pushing his way to the front of the saloon,
he stood in the doorway and shouted
with the full force of his lungs. He spoke
Slavic, and they listened. There were mutterings
and growls as might have been expected.
He gave no reason for the delay
of the attack, but his words suggested much.</p>
<p>Gerani, in the background, in low tones
was urging a group of Slavs to answer
O&#8217;Day, and declare that they would go on.
O&#8217;Day&#8217;s eyes were on the big Slav. He understood
the conditions. Nothing would
please Gerani better than to have the miners
rush upon the speaker and kill him.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Day understood. He called out, &#8220;Take
my word for it, Gerani. We won&#8217;t get into
this to-night. They&#8217;ve filled the cars on the
incline with dynamite. The moment we set
foot there, down comes the car. Do you
want your men blown to pieces? Besides,
my daughter,&#8221; he drew her against him,
&#8220;brings news of the militia close at hand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_384' name='page_384'></a>384</span>
Go back to your homes, men&mdash;back to bed.
Let the National Guards find you all asleep,
and their work for nothing. If they see all
quiet, they&#8217;ll leave. Then will come our
time. While I think of it, Gerani, Father
O&#8217;Brady still keeps safe in the church those
papers you know of.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sickerenza, you haven&#8217;t forgotten,
have you, about the breakers being burnt
up at Wilkes-Barre? Seeing you, put me
in mind of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Colowski, I know a man who&#8217;s looking
for Sobieski.&#8221;</p>
<p>The three men thus addressed swore beneath
their breath. Thus O&#8217;Day forever
kept the noose about their necks. They
slunk from sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Speak to the men, you curs,&#8221; commanded
O&#8217;Day in English which but a few
understood. &#8220;Tell them to go back home,
Gerani.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus admonished, the man cried out in
Slavic, ordering the men home, to meet the
following night. The other two leading
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_385' name='page_385'></a>385</span>
spirits followed his example. There was a
movement toward dispersion. The flickering
lights in their caps moved slowly away
in groups of threes and fours.</p>
<p>The distance grew greater until to Nora
O&#8217;Day they looked like fire-flies. The light
from the open door was upon her. The
vivid orange of her evening dress gleamed
in the shadows. She had stood there fearless,
erect, looking straight into the eyes of
the mob, until one by one they had disappeared
in the darkness.</p>
<p>Then she turned and leaned heavily
against her father.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m tired, daddy dear, but I&#8217;m happy.
I have my father, and Elizabeth will have
hers. Come, take me to her. We must tell
her the good news.&#8221;</p>
